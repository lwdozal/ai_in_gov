Esto en el entendimiento de que resulta\nfundamental generar claridad y seguridad juridica en el desarrollo actual y futuro de IA en\nnuestro pais, siendo los principios y valores éticos la piedra angular a partir de los cuales\n\ndebe estructurarse cualquier regulacién en la materia.\n\nA mas de veintidés afios de la promulgacion de la ley vigente, y considerando los nuevos\ndesarrollos cientificos y tecnoldgicos a los que se enfrenta no sdlo nuestro pais, sino el\nmundo, es necesaria la actualizacidn y modernizaci6n de la norma, de forma tal que\npromueva la investigacion, el desarrollo y la regulacién de la IA y, al mismo tiempo,\n\nacompaiie los avances tecnoldgicos y tendencias globales.\n\nEl concepto de una maquina capaz de procesar informacioén y tomar decisiones por si\nmisma se remonta a los afios 50, cuando los cientificos empezaron a trabajar en la idea de\ncrear ""maquinas de pensamiento"" que pudieran imitar la inteligencia humana. En las\ndécadas siguientes, la [A comenzo a tomar forma como una disciplina aut6noma, con el\ndesarrollo de algoritmos y modelos matematicos que permitian a las computadoras\naprender y adaptarse a diferentes situaciones y tareas. En particular, el concepto de ""redes\nneuronales"" comenzo a surgir en la década de 1960 como una forma de modelar la\nactividad del cerebro humano en una computadora, lo que permitid a los cientificos\n\ndesarrollar modelos de aprendizaje automatico y reconocimiento de patrones.\n\nA medida que la tecnologia avanz6, la |A comenzo a ser utilizada en aplicaciones practicas,\ncomo la clasificaci6n de imagenes, el reconocimiento de voz y la automatizacion de tareas\n\ncomplejas en la industria y los negocios.\n', 'DIPUTADOS\nARGENTINA\n\nCon el advenimiento de la era digital y la digitalizaci6n masiva de datos en la década de los\n2000, la IA volvid a tomar impulso, con el desarrollo de nuevas técnicas de aprendizaje\n\nprofundo y el aumento de la capacidad de procesamiento de las computadoras.\n\nActualmente, los sistemas de IA se utilizan en una amplia variedad de aplicaciones, desde\nasistentes virtuales y robots aut6nomos hasta diagndsticos médicos y analisis financiero,\n\nsiendo un campo en constante evoluci6n y expansion.\n\nConsideramos que esta evolucion debe realizarse siguiendo como lineamiento basico la\nbusqueda de beneficios para la humanidad. Para ello, resulta necesaria una legislaci6n que\n\nencuadre el ciclo de vida completo de las IA sobre los mas altos estandares éticos.\n\nTanto la investigacion cientifica como la tecnoldgica tienen el potencial de generar grandes\nbeneficios para la sociedad en su conjunto, y asi los avances en IA deben garantizar la\ncalidad y la seguridad de la investigacién mediante el establecimiento de normas y\n\nregulaciones claras.\n\nEn el afio 2019, la Organizaci6n de Naciones Unidas y UNESCO desarrollaron para sus\npaises miembros, entre ellos Argentina, una Recomendacion universal sobre la Etica de las\nInteligencias Artificiales en donde recomienda que los paises apliquen de manera\nvoluntaria, medidas legislativas de regulacién para estos nuevos sistemas en conformidad\ncon las normas universales de derecho internacional y respeto de los derechos humanos.\nEsta Recomendacién propone a su vez, que estos sistemas de Inteligencia Artificial se\nencuentren controlados por los gobiernos y que ademas se haga participe de los\npardmetros éticos a todas las partes interesadas tales como empresas, organizaciones\neducativas, universitarias y de investigacién, entre otras. Todo con el fin de que el\ndesarrollo y la utilizaci6n de estas tecnologias se guien tanto por una investigacién\n\ncientifica sdlida como un andlisis y una evaluacidén ética.\n\nEl Gobierno Nacional, los Gobiernos Provinciales y Municipales, el sector privado, la\nsociedad civil, las organizaciones internacionales, las comunidades técnicas y las\nuniversidades deben respetar los instrumentos y marcos éticos en sus intervenciones en\nlos procesos que rodean el ciclo de vida de los sistemas de Inteligencia Artificial.

Artificial intelligence.\n\nThis measure would urge the United States government to impose an immediately moratorium on the training of Al systems more\npowerful than GPT-4 for at least 6 months to allow time to develop much-needed Al governance systems.\n\nFiscal Committee: NO\n\nWHEREAS, Top artificial intelligence (Al) labs acknowledge that Al systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks\nto society and humanity; and\n\nWHEREAS, The widely endorsed Asilomar Al Principles state that advanced Al could represent a profound change in the history of life\non Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources; and\n\nWHEREAS, Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen Al labs\nlocked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one, not even their creators, can understand,\n\npredict, or reliably control; and\n\nWHEREAS, Contemporary Al systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we\nlet machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling\nones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of\ncontrol of our civilization? These decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders; and\n\nWHEREAS, Powerful Al systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be\nmanageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system\'s potential effects; and\n\nWHEREAS, Open Al\'s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that, ""At some point, it may be important to get\nindependent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute\nused for creating new models."" We agree. That point is now; and\n\nWHEREAS, Time is needed to develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced Al design and development that are\nrigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts and that ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a\nreasonable doubt; and\n\nWHEREAS, Al research and development should be refocused on making today\'s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate,\nsafe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal; and\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=|D:bill: CAZ023000AJR6&verid=CA2023000AJR6_20230504_0_I& 1/2\n', '3/31/25, 3:02 PM Bill Resource\n\nWHEREAS, In order to continue the development of Al without engaging in the dangerous race to ever-larger, unpredictable black-box\nmodels with emergent capabilities, Al developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of robust Al\ngovernance systems. These should, at a minimum, include: new and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to Al; oversight and tracking of\nhighly capable Al systems and large pools of computational capability; provenance and watermarking systems to help distinguish real from\nsynthetic and to track model leaks; a robust auditing and certification ecosystem; liability for Al-caused harm; robust public funding for\ntechnical Al safety research; and well-resourced institutions for coping with the dramatic economic and political disruptions (especially to\ndemocracy) that Al will cause; and\n\nWHEREAS, Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with Al. Having succeeded in creating powerful Al systems, we can now enjoy an ""Al\nsummer"" in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt. Society has\nhit pause on other technologies with potentially catastrophic effects on society. We can do so here.

Permanent living\narrangements may include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for at home\nwithout endangering the child\'s health or safety; reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement is\nnecessary; or movement of the child toward the most permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 37/510\n', ""3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n\nWhen determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in making such\nreasonable efforts, the child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.\n\nWhen a child is placed in foster care, the Department shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to prevent or\neliminate the need to remove the child from the child's home.

The objectives of the Illinois Solar for All Program are to bring photovoltaics to low-income communities in this State in a\nmanner that maximizes the development of new photovoltaic generating facilities, to create a long-term, low-income solar marketplace\nthroughout this State, to integrate, through interaction with stakeholders, with existing energy efficiency initiatives, and to minimize\nadministrative costs. The Illinois Solar for All Program shall be implemented in a manner that seeks to minimize administrative costs, and\nmaximize efficiencies and synergies available through coordination with similar initiatives, including the Adjustable Block program\ndescribed in subparagraphs (K) through (M) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75, energy efficiency programs, job training\nprograms, and community action agencies. The Agency shall strive to ensure that renewable energy credits procured through the Illinois\nSolar for All Program and each of its subprograms are purchased from projects across the breadth of low-income and environmental\njustice communities in Illinois, including both urban and rural communities, are not concentrated in a few communities, and do not\nexclude particular low-income or environmental justice communities. The Agency shall include a description of its proposed approach to\nhe design, administration, implementation and evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program, as part of the long-term renewable\nresources procurement plan authorized by subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act, and the program shall be designed to grow the low-\nincome solar market. The Agency or utility, as applicable, shall purchase renewable energy credits from the (i) photovoltaic distributed\nrenewable energy generation projects and (ii) community solar projects that are procured under procurement processes authorized by\nhe long-term renewable resources procurement plans approved by the Commission.\n\nThe Illinois Solar for All Program shall include the program offerings described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph\n(2), which the Agency shall implement through contracts with third-party providers and, subject to appropriation, pay the approximate\namounts identified using monies available in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund. Each contract that provides\nfor the installation of solar facilities shall provide that the solar facilities will produce energy and economic benefits, at a level determined\nby the Agency to be reasonable, for the participating low-income tewdrneeme customers. The monies available in the Illinois Power\nAgency Renewable Energy Resources Fund and not otherwise committed to contracts executed under subsection (i) of this Section, as\nwell as, in the case of the programs described under subparagraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph (2), funding authorized pursuant to\nsubparagraph (O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act, shall initially be allocated among the programs described\nin this paragraph (2), as follows: 35% of these funds shall be allocated to programs described in subparagraphs (A) and (E) of this\nparagraph (2), 40% of these funds shall be allocated to programs described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (2), and 25% of these\nfunds shall be allocated to programs described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2). The allocation of funds among subparagraphs\n(A), (B), (C), and (E) of this paragraph (2) may be changed if the Agency, after receiving input through a stakeholder process, determines\nincentives in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), or (E) of this paragraph (2) have not been adequately subscribed to fully utilize available Illinois\nSolar for All Program funds.\n\nContracts that will be paid with funds in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund shall be executed by the\nAgency. Contracts that will be paid with funds collected by an electric utility shall be executed by the electric utility.\n\nContracts under the Illinois Solar for All Program shall include an approach, as set forth in the long-term renewable resources\nprocurement plans, to ensure the wholesale market value of the energy is credited to participating low-income customers or\norganizations and to ensure tangible economic benefits flow directly to program participants, except in the case of low-income multi-\nfamily housing where the low-income customer does not directly pay for energy. Priority shall be given to projects that demonstrate\nmeaningful involvement of low-income community members in designing the initial proposals. Acceptable proposals to implement\nprojects must demonstrate the applicant's ability to conduct initial community outreach, education, and recruitment of low-income\nparticipants in the community. Projects must include job training opportunities if available, with the specific level of trainee usage to be\ndetermined through the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan, and the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator\nshall coordinate with the job training programs described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities\nAct and in the Energy Transition Act.\n\nThe Agency shall make every effort to ensure that small and emerging businesses, particularly those located in low-income and\nenvironmental justice communities, are able to participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program. These efforts may include, but shall not be\nlimited to, proactive support from the program administrator, different or preferred access to subprograms and administrator-identified\ncustomers or grassroots education provider-identified customers, and different incentive levels. The Agency shall report on progress and\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 61/510\n"", ""3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n\nbarriers to participation of small and emerging businesses in the Illinois Solar for All Program at least once a year. The report shall be\nmade available on the Agency's website and, in years when the Agency is updating its long-term renewable resources procurement plan,\nincluded in that Plan.\n\n(A) Low-income single-family and small multifamily solar incentive. This program will provide incentives to low-income customers,\neither directly or through solar providers, to increase the participation of low-income households in photovoltaic on-site distributed\ngeneration at residential buildings containing one to 4 units. Companies participating in this program that install solar panels shall commit\nto hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that\ninstall solar panels with entities that provide solar panel installation job training. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the\nincentives for this program be allocated to projects located within environmental justice communities. Contracts entered into under this\nparagraph may be entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program and shall also include contracts for renewable\nenergy credits from the photovoltaic distributed generation that is the subject of the program, as set forth in the long-term renewable\nresources procurement plan. Additionally:\n\n(i) The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership of projects by\nlow-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, community\ncooperatives, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households. Projects that feature energy\nownership should ensure that local people have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill\nsavings. The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by\ncommunities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for projects that promote energy sovereignty may be higher than incentives\nfor equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty under this same program.\n\n(ii) Through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall consider additional program and contract\nrequirements to ensure faithful compliance by applicants benefiting from preferences for projects designated to promote energy\nsovereignty. The Agency shall make every effort to enable solar providers already participating in the Adjustable Block Program Bleek\nPregrar under subparagraph (K) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act, and particularly solar providers\ndeveloping projects under item (i) of subparagraph (K) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act to easily participate\nin the Low-Income Distributed Generation Incentive program described under this subparagraph (A), and vice versa. This effort may\ninclude, but shall not be limited to, utilizing similar or the same application systems and processes, similar or the same forms and\nformats of communication, and providing active outreach to companies participating in one program but not the other. The Agency shall\nreport on efforts made to encourage this cross-participation in its long-term renewable resources procurement plan.\n\n(B) Low-Income Community Solar Project Initiative. Incentives shall be offered to low-income customers, either directly or through\ndevelopers, to increase the participation of low-income subscribers of community solar projects. The developer of each project shall\nidentify its partnership with community stakeholders regarding the location, development, and participation in the project, provided that\nnothing shall preclude a project from including an anchor tenant that does not qualify as low-income. Companies participating in this\nprogram that develop or install solar projects shall commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an\nadministrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar projects with entities that provide solar installation and related job\ntraining. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the incentives for this program be allocated to community photovoltaic\nprojects in environmental justice communities. The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy\nsovereignty through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income\nhouseholds, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households.\nProjects that feature energy ownership should ensure that local people have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over\nand above energy bill savings. The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve\npartial project ownership by communities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for projects that promote energy sovereignty may\nbe higher than incentives for equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty under this same program. Contracts entered\ninto under this paragraph may be entered into with developers and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits related to\nthe program.\n\n(C) Incentives for non-profits and public facilities. Under this program funds shall be used to support on-site photovoltaic distributed\nrenewable energy generation devices to serve the load associated with not-for-profit customers and to support photovoltaic distributed\nrenewable energy generation that uses photovoltaic technology to serve the load associated with public sector customers taking service\nat public buildings. Companies participating in this program that develop or install solar projects shall commit to hiring job trainees for a\nportion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar projects with\nentities that provide solar installation and related job training. Through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency\nshall consider additional program and contract requirements to ensure faithful compliance by applicants benefiting from preferences for\nprojects designated to promote energy sovereignty. It is a goal of this program that at least 25% of the incentives for this program be\nallocated to projects located in environmental justice communities. Contracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with\nan entity that will develop and administer the program or with developers and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits\nrelated to the program.\n\n(D) (Blank).\n\n(E) Low-income large multifamily solar incentive. This program shall provide incentives to low-income customers, either directly or\nthrough solar providers, to increase the participation of low-income households in photovoltaic on-site distributed generation at\nresidential buildings with 5 or more units. Companies participating in this program that develop or install solar projects shall commit to\nhiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install\nsolar projects with entities that provide solar installation and related job training. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the\nincentives for this program be allocated to projects located within environmental justice communities. The Agency shall reserve a portion\nof this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit\norganizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies\nproviding services to low-income households.

The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that\npromote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by communities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for\nprojects that promote energy sovereignty may be higher than incentives for equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty\nunder this same program.\n\nThe requirement that a qualified person, as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (i) of this Section, install photovoltaic devices\ndoes not apply to the Illinois Solar for All Program described in this subsection (b).\n\nIn addition to the programs outlined in paragraphs (A) through (E), the Agency and other parties may propose additional programs\nthrough the Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan developed and approved under paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of\nSection 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. Additional programs may target market segments not specified above and may also include\nincentives targeted to increase the uptake of nonphotovoltaic technologies by low-income customers, including energy storage paired\nwith photovoltaics, if the Commission determines that the Illinois Solar for All Program would provide greater benefits to the public health\nand well-being of low-income residents through also supporting that additional program versus supporting programs already authorized.\n\n(3) Costs associated with the Illinois Solar for All Program and its components described in paragraph (2) of this subsection (b),\nincluding, but not limited to, costs associated with procuring experts, consultants, and the program administrator referenced in this\nsubsection (b) and related incremental costs, costs related to income verification and facilitating customer participation in the program,\nand costs related to the evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program, may be paid for using monies in the Illinois Power Agency\nRenewable Energy Resources Fund, and funds allocated pursuant to subparagraph (O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-\n75, but the Agency or program administrator shall strive to minimize costs in the implementation of the program. The Agency or\ncontracting electric utility shall purchase renewable energy credits from generation that is the subject of a contract under subparagraphs\n(A) through (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection (b), and may pay for such renewable energy credits through an upfront payment per\ninstalled kilowatt of nameplate capacity paid once the device is interconnected at the distribution system level of the interconnecting\nutility and verified as energized. Payments for renewable energy credits shall be in exchange for all renewable energy credits generated\nby the system during the first 15 years of operation and shall be structured to overcome barriers to participation in the solar market by\nthe low-income community. The incentives provided for in this Section may be implemented through the pricing of renewable energy\ncredits where the prices paid for the credits are higher than the prices from programs offered under subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this\nAct to account for the additional capital necessary to successfully access targeted market segments. The Agency or contracting electric\nutility shall retire any renewable energy credits purchased under this program and the credits shall count toward tewards the obligation\nunder subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act for the electric utility to which the project is interconnected, if applicable.\n\nThe Agency shall direct that up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All Program to community-based groups and\nother qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts related to the Illinois Solar for All Program, including\ngeneral energy education, job training program outreach efforts, and other activities deemed to be qualified by the Agency. Grassroots\neducation funding shall not be used to support the marketing by solar project development firms and organizations, unless such\neducation provides equal opportunities for all applicable firms and organizations.\n\n(4) The Agency shall, consistent with the requirements of this subsection (b), propose the Illinois Solar for All Program terms,\nconditions, and requirements, including the prices to be paid for renewable energy credits, and which prices may be determined through\na formula, through the development, review, and approval of the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan described in\nsubsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In the course of the Commission proceeding\ninitiated to review and approve the plan, including the Illinois Solar for All Program proposed by the Agency, a party may propose an\nadditional low-income solar or solar incentive program, or modifications to the programs proposed by the Agency, and the Commission\nmay approve an additional program, or modifications to the Agency's proposed program, if the additional or modified program more\neffectively maximizes the benefits to low-income customers after taking into account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the\nextent to which a competitive market for low-income solar has developed. Following the Commission's approval of the Illinois Solar for All\nProgram, the Agency or a party may propose adjustments to the program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the price\noffered to new systems, to ensure the long-term viability and success of the program. The Commission shall review and approve any\nmodifications to the program through the plan revision process described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.\n\n(5) The Agency shall issue a request for qualifications for a third-party program administrator or administrators to administer all or a\nportion of the Illinois Solar for All Program.

The Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional funding has\nbeen provided for the new benefit increase and shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of the Department of Insurance. A\nnew benefit increase created by a Public Act that does not include the additional funding required under this subsection is null and void.\nIf the Public Pension Division determines that the additional funding provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is or has\nbecome inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action by the General\nAssembly, the new benefit increase shall expire at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is made.\n\n(d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified in the\nlanguage enacting the new benefit increase or provided under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General Assembly from\nextending or re-creating a new benefit increase by law.\n\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires under this\nSection continues to apply to persons who applied and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit increase was in effect and\nto the affected beneficiaries and alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any other person, including, without limitation, a\nperson who continues in service after the expiration date and did not apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new benefit\nincrease was in effect.\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 103-80, eff. 6-9-23; 103-548, eff. 8-11-23; revised 8-31-23.)\n(40 ILCS 5/16-127) (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 16-127)\nSec. 16-127.

The PUNS database is also available for children with intellectual disabilities or developmental\ndisabilities with unmet service needs.\n\n(4) Registration to be included on the PUNS database is the first step toward receiving developmental disabilities services in this\nState. A child or an adult who is not on the PUNS database will not be in queue for State developmental disabilities services.\n\n(5) Lack of awareness and information about the PUNS database results in underutilization or delays in registration for the PUNS\ndatabase by students with intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities and their parents or guardians.\n\n(a-5) The purpose of this Section is to ensure that each student with an intellectual disability or a developmental disability who has\nan individualized education program (""IEP"") and the student\'s parents or guardian are informed about the PUNS database, where to\nregister for the PUNS database, and whom they can contact for information about the PUNS database and the PUNS database\nregistration process.

Evidence-Based Funding for student success for the 2017-2018 and subsequent school years.\n(a) General provisions.\n\n(1) The purpose of this Section is to ensure that, by June 30, 2027 and beyond, this State has a kindergarten through grade 12\npublic education system with the capacity to ensure the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities in\naccordance with Section 1 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Illinois. To accomplish that objective, this Section creates a\nmethod of funding public education that is evidence-based; is sufficient to ensure every student receives a meaningful opportunity to\nlearn irrespective of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or community-income level; and is sustainable and predictable. When fully\nfunded under this Section, every school shall have the resources, based on what the evidence indicates is needed, to:\n\n(A) provide all students with a high quality education that offers the academic, enrichment, social and emotional support, technical,\nand career-focused programs that will allow them to become competitive workers, responsible parents, productive citizens of this State,\nand active members of our national democracy;\n\n(B) ensure all students receive the education they need to graduate from high school with the skills required to pursue post-\nsecondary education and training for a rewarding career;\n\n(C) reduce, with a goal of eliminating, the achievement gap between at-risk and non-at-risk students by raising the performance of\nat-risk students and not by reducing standards; and\n\n(D) ensure this State satisfies its obligation to assume the primary responsibility to fund public education and simultaneously relieve\nthe disproportionate burden placed on local property taxes to fund schools.\n\n(2) The Evidence-Based Funding formula under this Section shall be applied to all Organizational Units in this State. The Evidence-\nBased Funding formula outlined in this Act is based on the formula outlined in Senate Bill 1 of the 100th General Assembly, as passed by\nboth legislative chambers. As further defined and described in this Section, there are 4 major components of the Evidence-Based\nFunding model:\n\n(A) First, the model calculates a unique Adequacy Target for each Organizational Unit in this State that considers the costs to\nimplement research-based activities, the unit\'s student demographics, and regional wage differences.\n\n(B) Second, the model calculates each Organizational Unit\'s Local Capacity, or the amount each Organizational Unit is assumed to\ncontribute toward its Adequacy Target from local resources.\n\n(C) Third, the model calculates how much funding the State currently contributes to the Organizational Unit and adds that to the\nunit\'s Local Capacity to determine the unit\'s overall current adequacy of funding.\n\n(D) Finally, the model\'s distribution method allocates new State funding to those Organizational Units that are least well-funded,\nconsidering both Local Capacity and State funding, in relation to their Adequacy Target.\n\n(3) An Organizational Unit receiving any funding under this Section may apply those funds to any fund so received for which that\nOrganizational Unit is authorized to make expenditures by law.\n\n(4) As used in this Section, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this paragraph (4):\n""Adequacy Target"" is defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Section.\n\n""Adjusted EAV"" is defined in paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Section.\n\n""Adjusted Local Capacity Target"" is defined in paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this Section.\n\n""Adjusted Operating Tax Rate"" means a tax rate for all Organizational Units, for which the State Superintendent shall calculate and\nsubtract for the Operating Tax Rate a transportation rate based on total expenses for transportation services under this Code, as\nreported on the most recent Annual Financial Report in Pupil Transportation Services, function 2550 in both the Education and\nTransportation funds and functions 4110 and 4120 in the Transportation fund, less any corresponding fiscal year State of Illinois\nscheduled payments excluding net adjustments for prior years for regular, vocational, or special education transportation reimbursement\npursuant to Section 29-5 or subsection (b) of Section 14-13.01 of this Code divided by the Adjusted EAV. If an Organizational Unit\'s\ncorresponding fiscal year State of Illinois scheduled payments excluding net adjustments for prior years for regular, vocational, or special\neducation transportation reimbursement pursuant to Section 29-5 or subsection (b) of Section 14-13.01 of this Code exceed the total\ntransportation expenses, as defined in this paragraph, no transportation rate shall be subtracted from the Operating Tax Rate.\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 190/510\n', '3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n""Allocation Rate"" is defined in paragraph (3) of subsection (g) of this Section.\n\n""Alternative School"" means a public school that is created and operated by a regional superintendent of schools and approved by\nthe State Board.\n\n""Applicable Tax Rate"" is defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this Section.\n\n""Assessment"" means any of those benchmark, progress monitoring, formative, diagnostic, and other assessments, in addition to the\nState accountability assessment, that assist teachers\' needs in understanding the skills and meeting the needs of the students they\nserve.\n\n""Assistant principal"" means a school administrator duly endorsed to be employed as an assistant principal in this State.\n\n""At-risk student"" means a student who is at risk of not meeting the Illinois Learning Standards or not graduating from elementary or\nhigh school and who demonstrates a need for vocational support or social services beyond that provided by the regular school program.\nAll students included in an Organizational Unit\'s Low-Income Count, as well as all English learner and disabled students attending the\nOrganizational Unit, shall be considered at-risk students under this Section.\n\n""Average Student Enrollment"" or ""ASE"" for fiscal year 2018 means, for an Organizational Unit, the greater of the average number of\nstudents (grades K through 12) reported to the State Board as enrolled in the Organizational Unit on October 1 in the immediately\npreceding school year, plus the pre-kindergarten students who receive special education services of 2 or more hours a day as reported\nto the State Board on December 1 in the immediately preceding school year, or the average number of students (grades K through 12)\nreported to the State Board as enrolled in the Organizational Unit on October 1, plus the pre-kindergarten students who receive special\neducation services of 2 or more hours a day as reported to the State Board on December 1, for each of the immediately preceding 3\nschool years. For fiscal year 2019 and each subsequent fiscal year, ""Average Student Enrollment"" or ""ASE"" means, for an\nOrganizational Unit, the greater of the average number of students (grades K through 12) reported to the State Board as enrolled in the\nOrganizational Unit on October 1 and March 1 in the immediately preceding school year, plus the pre-kindergarten students who receive\nspecial education services as reported to the State Board on October 1 and March 1 in the immediately preceding school year, or the\naverage number of students (grades K through 12) reported to the State Board as enrolled in the Organizational Unit on October 1 and\nMarch 1, plus the pre-kindergarten students who receive special education services as reported to the State Board on October 1 and\nMarch 1, for each of the immediately preceding 3 school years. For the purposes of this definition, “enrolled in the Organizational Unit""\nmeans the number of students reported to the State Board who are enrolled in schools within the Organizational Unit that the student\nattends or would attend if not placed or transferred to another school or program to receive needed services. For the purposes of\ncalculating ""ASE"", all students, grades K through 12, excluding those attending kindergarten for a half day and students attending an\nalternative education program operated by a regional office of education or intermediate service center, shall be counted as 1.0. All\nstudents attending kindergarten for a half day shall be counted as 0.5, unless in 2017 by June 15 or by March 1 in subsequent years, the\nschool district reports to the State Board of Education the intent to implement full-day kindergarten district-wide for all students, then all\nstudents attending kindergarten shall be counted as 1.0. Special education pre-kindergarten students shall be counted as 0.5 each. If the\nState Board does not collect or has not collected both an October 1 and March 1 enrollment count by grade or a December 1 collection\nof special education pre-kindergarten students as of August 31, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 100-465), it shall establish such\ncollection for all future years. For any year in which a count by grade level was collected only once, that count shall be used as the single\ncount available for computing a 3-year average ASE. Funding for programs operated by a regional office of education or an intermediate\nservice center must be calculated using the Evidence-Based Funding formula under this Section for the 2019-2020 school year and each\nsubsequent school year until separate adequacy formulas are developed and adopted for each type of program. ASE for a program\noperated by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center must be determined by the March 1 enrollment for the\nprogram. For the 2019-2020 school year, the ASE used in the calculation must be the first-year ASE and, in that year only, the\nassignment of students served by a regional office of education or intermediate service center shall not result in a reduction of the March\nenrollment for any school district. For the 2020-2021 school year, the ASE must be the greater of the current-year ASE or the 2-year\naverage ASE. Beginning with the 2021-2022 school year, the ASE must be the greater of the current-year ASE or the 3-year average\nASE. School districts shall submit the data for the ASE calculation to the State Board within 45 days of the dates required in this Section\nfor submission of enrollment data in order for it to be included in the ASE calculation. For fiscal year 2018 only, the ASE calculation shall\ninclude only enrollment taken on October 1. In recognition of the impact of COVID-19, the definition of ""Average Student Enrollment"" or\n""ASE"" shall be adjusted for calculations under this Section for fiscal years 2022 through 2024. For fiscal years 2022 through 2024, the\nenrollment used in the calculation of ASE representing the 2020-2021 school year shall be the greater of the enrollment for the 2020-\n2021 school year or the 2019-2020 school year.\n\n""Base Funding Guarantee"" is defined in paragraph (10) of subsection (g) of this Section.\n""Base Funding Minimum"" is defined in subsection (e) of this Section.\n""Base Tax Year"" means the property tax levy year used to calculate the Budget Year allocation of primary State aid.\n\n""Base Tax Year\'s Extension"" means the product of the equalized assessed valuation utilized by the county clerk in the Base Tax\nYear multiplied by the limiting rate as calculated by the county clerk and defined in PTELL.\n\n""Bilingual Education Allocation"" means the amount of an Organizational Unit\'s final Adequacy Target attributable to bilingual\neducation divided by the Organizational Unit\'s final Adequacy Target, the product of which shall be multiplied by the amount of new\nfunding received pursuant to this Section.

The calculation of Local\nCapacity Percentage is described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2).\n\n(B) An Organizational Unit\'s Local Capacity Ratio in a given year is the percentage obtained by dividing its Adjusted EAV or PTELL\nEAV, whichever is less, by its Adequacy Target, with the resulting ratio further adjusted as follows:\n\n(i) for Organizational Units serving grades kindergarten through 12 and Hybrid Districts, no further adjustments shall be made;\n(ii) for Organizational Units serving grades kindergarten through 8, the ratio shall be multiplied by 9/13;\n(iii) for Organizational Units serving grades 9 through 12, the Local Capacity Ratio shall be multiplied by 4/13; and\n\n(iv) for an Organizational Unit with a different grade configuration than those specified in items (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph\n(B), the State Superintendent shall determine a comparable adjustment based on the grades served.\n\n(C) The Local Capacity Percentage is equal to the percentile ranking of the district. Local Capacity Percentage converts each\nOrganizational Unit\'s Local Capacity Ratio to a cumulative distribution resulting in a percentile ranking to determine each Organizational\nUnit\'s relative position to all other Organizational Units in this State. The Local Capacity Percentage cumulative distribution resulting ina\npercentile ranking for each Organizational Unit shall be calculated using the standard normal distribution of the score in relation to the\nweighted mean and weighted standard deviation and Local Capacity Ratios of all Organizational Units. If the value assigned to any\nOrganizational Unit is in excess of 90%, the value shall be adjusted to 90%. For Laboratory Schools, the Local Capacity Percentage\nshall be set at 10% in recognition of the absence of EAV and resources from the public university that are allocated to the Laboratory\nSchool. For programs operated by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center, the Local Capacity Percentage must\nbe set at 10% in recognition of the absence of EAV and resources from school districts that are allocated to the regional office of\neducation or intermediate service center. The weighted mean for the Local Capacity Percentage shall be determined by multiplying each\nOrganizational Unit\'s Local Capacity Ratio times the ASE for the unit creating a weighted value, summing the weighted values of all\nOrganizational Units, and dividing by the total ASE of all Organizational Units. The weighted standard deviation shall be determined by\ntaking the square root of the weighted variance of all Organizational Units\' Local Capacity Ratio, where the variance is calculated by\nsquaring the difference between each unit\'s Local Capacity Ratio and the weighted mean, then multiplying the variance for each unit\ntimes the ASE for the unit to create a weighted variance for each unit, then summing all units\' weighted variance and dividing by the total\nASE of all units.\n\n(D) For any Organizational Unit, the Organizational Unit\'s Adjusted Local Capacity Target shall be reduced by either (i) the school\nboard\'s remaining contribution pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subsection (b-4) of Section 16-158 of the Illinois Pension Code in a given\nyear or (ii) the board of education\'s remaining contribution pursuant to paragraph (iv) of subsection (b) of Section 17-129 of the Illinois\nPension Code absent the employer normal cost portion of the required contribution and amount allowed pursuant to subdivision (3) of\nSection 17-142.1 of the Illinois Pension Code in a given year.

The Adjusted Local Capacity Target is calculated as the sum\nof the Organizational Unit\'s Local Capacity Target and its Real Receipts Adjustment. The Real Receipts Adjustment equals the\nOrganizational Unit\'s Real Receipts less its Local Capacity Target, with the resulting figure multiplied by the Local Capacity Percentage.\n\nAs used in this paragraph (3), ""Real Percent of Adequacy"" means the sum of an Organizational Unit\'s Real Receipts, CPPRT, and\nBase Funding Minimum, with the resulting figure divided by the Organizational Unit\'s Adequacy Target.\n\n(d) Calculation of Real Receipts, EAV, and Adjusted EAV for purposes of the Local Capacity calculation.\n\n(1) An Organizational Unit\'s Real Receipts are the product of its Applicable Tax Rate and its Adjusted EAV.

Initially, an Organizational\nUnit's Preliminary Resources and Preliminary Percent of Adequacy are calculated pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (f). Then,\nan Organizational Unit's Final Resources and Final Percent of Adequacy are calculated to account for the Organizational Unit's poverty\nconcentration levels pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection (f).\n\n(2) An Organizational Unit's Preliminary Resources are equal to the sum of its Local Capacity Target, CPPRT, and Base Funding\nMinimum. An Organizational Unit's Preliminary Percent of Adequacy is the lesser of (i) its Preliminary Resources divided by its Adequacy\nTarget or (ii) 100%.\n\n(3) Except for Specially Funded Units, an Organizational Unit's Final Resources are equal to the sum of its Local Capacity, CPPRT,\nand Adjusted Base Funding Minimum. The Base Funding Minimum of each Specially Funded Unit shall serve as its Final Resources,\nexcept that the Base Funding Minimum for State-approved charter schools shall not include any portion of general State aid allocated in\nthe prior year based on the per capita tuition charge times the charter school enrollment.\n\n(4) An Organizational Unit's Final Percent of Adequacy is its Final Resources divided by its Adequacy Target. An Organizational\nUnit's Adjusted Base Funding Minimum is equal to its Base Funding Minimum less its Supplemental Grant Funding, with the resulting\nfigure added to the product of its Supplemental Grant Funding and Preliminary Percent of Adequacy.\n\n(g) Evidence-Based Funding formula distribution system.\n\n(1) In each school year under the Evidence-Based Funding formula, each Organizational Unit receives funding equal to the sum of\nits Base Funding Minimum and the unit's allocation of New State Funds determined pursuant to this subsection (g). To allocate New\nState Funds, the Evidence-Based Funding formula distribution system first places all Organizational Units into one of 4 tiers in\naccordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection (g), based on the Organizational Unit's Final Percent of Adequacy. New State Funds\nare allocated to each of the 4 tiers as follows: Tier 1 Aggregate Funding equals 50% of all New State Funds, Tier 2 Aggregate Funding\nequals 49% of all New State Funds, Tier 3 Aggregate Funding equals 0.9% of all New State Funds, and Tier 4 Aggregate Funding equals\n0.1% of all New State Funds. Each Organizational Unit within Tier 1 or Tier 2 receives an allocation of New State Funds equal to its tier\nFunding Gap, as defined in the following sentence, multiplied by the tier's Allocation Rate determined pursuant to paragraph (4) of this\nsubsection (g). For Tier 1, an Organizational Unit's Funding Gap equals the tier's Target Ratio, as specified in paragraph (5) of this\nsubsection (g), multiplied by the Organizational Unit's Adequacy Target, with the resulting amount reduced by the Organizational Unit's\nFinal Resources. For Tier 2, an Organizational Unit's Funding Gap equals the tier's Target Ratio, as described in paragraph (5) of this\nsubsection (g), multiplied by the Organizational Unit's Adequacy Target, with the resulting amount reduced by the Organizational Unit's\nFinal Resources and its Tier 1 funding allocation. To determine the Organizational Unit's Funding Gap, the resulting amount is then\nmultiplied by a factor equal to one minus the Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Target percentage. Each Organizational Unit within\nTier 3 or Tier 4 receives an allocation of New State Funds equal to the product of its Adequacy Target and the tier's Allocation Rate, as\nspecified in paragraph (4) of this subsection (g).\n\n(2) To ensure equitable distribution of dollars for all Tier 2 Organizational Units, no Tier 2 Organizational Unit shall receive fewer\ndollars per ASE than any Tier 3 Organizational Unit. Each Tier 2 and Tier 3 Organizational Unit shall have its funding allocation divided\nby its ASE. Any Tier 2 Organizational Unit with a funding allocation per ASE below the greatest Tier 3 allocation per ASE shall get a\nfunding allocation equal to the greatest Tier 3 funding allocation per ASE multiplied by the Organizational Unit's ASE. Each Tier 2\nOrganizational Unit's Tier 2 funding allocation shall be multiplied by the percentage calculated by dividing the original Tier 2 Aggregate\nFunding by the sum of all Tier 2 Organizational Units' Tier 2 funding allocation after adjusting districts' funding below Tier 3 levels.\n\n(3) Organizational Units are placed into one of 4 tiers as follows:\n\n(A) Tier 1 consists of all Organizational Units, except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of Adequacy less than the Tier 1\nTarget Ratio. The Tier 1 Target Ratio is the ratio level that allows for Tier 1 Aggregate Funding to be distributed, with the Tier 1 Allocation\nRate determined pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection (g).\n\n(B) Tier 2 consists of all Tier 1 Units and all other Organizational Units, except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of\nAdequacy of less than 0.90.\n\n(C) Tier 3 consists of all Organizational Units, except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of Adequacy of at least 0.90 and\nless than 1.0.\n\n(D) Tier 4 consists of all Organizational Units with a Percent of Adequacy of at least 1.0.\n\n(4) The Allocation Rates for Tiers 1 through 4 are determined as follows:\n\n(A) The Tier 1 Allocation Rate is 30%.\n\n(B) The Tier 2 Allocation Rate is the result of the following equation: Tier 2 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Funding\nGaps for all Tier 2 Organizational Units, unless the result of such equation is higher than 1.0. If the result of such equation is higher than\n\n1.0, then the Tier 2 Allocation Rate is 1.0.\n\n(C) The Tier 3 Allocation Rate is the result of the following equation: Tier 3 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Adequacy\nTargets of all Tier 3 Organizational Units.\n\n(D) The Tier 4 Allocation Rate is the result of the following equation: Tier 4 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Adequacy\nTargets of all Tier 4 Organizational Units.\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 201/510\n"", ""3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n(5) A tier's Target Ratio is determined as follows:\n\n(A) The Tier 1 Target Ratio is the ratio level that allows for Tier 1 Aggregate Funding to be distributed with the Tier 1 Allocation Rate.\n(B) The Tier 2 Target Ratio is 0.90.\n(C) The Tier 3 Target Ratio is 1.0.\n\n(6) If, at any point, the Tier 1 Target Ratio is greater than 90%, then all Tier 1 funding shall be allocated to Tier 2 and no Tier 1\nOrganizational Unit's funding may be identified.\n\n(7) In the event that all Tier 2 Organizational Units receive funding at the Tier 2 Target Ratio level, any remaining New State Funds\nshall be allocated to Tier 3 and Tier 4 Organizational Units.\n\n(8) If any Specially Funded Units, excluding Glenwood Academy, recognized by the State Board do not qualify for direct funding\nfollowing the implementation of Public Act 100-465 from any of the funding sources included within the definition of Base Funding\nMinimum, the unqualified portion of the Base Funding Minimum shall be transferred to one or more appropriate Organizational Units as\ndetermined by the State Superintendent based on the prior year ASE of the Organizational Units.\n\n(8.5) If a school district withdraws from a special education cooperative, the portion of the Base Funding Minimum that is attributable\nto the school district may be redistributed to the school district upon withdrawal.

The target for State funding of New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds is\n$50,000,000 for State fiscal year 2019 and subsequent State fiscal years. The Minimum Funding Level is equal to $350,000,000. In\naddition to any New State Funds, no more than $50,000,000 New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds may be counted toward the Minimum\nFunding Level. If the sum of New State Funds and applicable New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds are less than the Minimum Funding\nLevel, than funding for tiers shall be reduced in the following manner:\n\n(A) First, Tier 4 funding shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State\nFunds until such time as Tier 4 funding is exhausted.\n\n(B) Next, Tier 3 funding shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State\nFunds and the reduction in Tier 4 funding until such time as Tier 3 funding is exhausted.\n\n(C) Next, Tier 2 funding shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State\nFunds and the reduction in Tier 4 and Tier 3.\n\n(D) Finally, Tier 1 funding shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding level and New State\nFunds and the reduction in Tier 2, 3, and 4 funding. In addition, the Allocation Rate for Tier 1 shall be reduced to a percentage equal to\nthe Tier 1 Allocation Rate set by paragraph (4) of this subsection (g), multiplied by the result of New State Funds divided by the Minimum\nFunding Level.\n\n(9.5) For State fiscal year 2019 and subsequent State fiscal years, if New State Funds exceed $300,000,000, then any amount in\nexcess of $300,000,000 shall be dedicated for purposes of Section 2-3.170 of this Code up to a maximum of $50,000,000.\n\n(10) In the event of a decrease in the amount of the appropriation for this Section in any fiscal year after implementation of this\nSection, the Organizational Units receiving Tier 1 and Tier 2 funding, as determined under paragraph (3) of this subsection (g), shall be\nheld harmless by establishing a Base Funding Guarantee equal to the per pupil kindergarten through grade 12 funding received in\naccordance with this Section in the prior fiscal year. Reductions shall be made to the Base Funding Minimum of Organizational Units in\nTier 3 and Tier 4 on a per pupil basis equivalent to the total number of the ASE in Tier 3-funded and Tier 4-funded Organizational Units\ndivided by the total reduction in State funding. The Base Funding Minimum as reduced shall continue to be applied to Tier 3 and Tier 4\nOrganizational Units and adjusted by the relative formula when increases in appropriations for this Section resume.

Whole Child Task Force.\n(a) The General Assembly makes all of the following findings:\n\n(1) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic inequities in American society. Students, educators, and families throughout this\nState have been deeply affected by the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic will be felt for years to come. The negative\nconsequences of the pandemic have impacted students and communities differently along the lines of race, income, language, and\nspecial needs. However, students in this State faced significant unmet physical health, mental health, and social and emotional needs\neven prior to the pandemic.\n\n(2) The path to recovery requires a commitment from adults in this State to address our students cultural, physical, emotional, and\nmental health needs and to provide them with stronger and increased systemic support and intervention.\n\n(3) It is well documented that trauma and toxic stress diminish a child's ability to thrive. Forms of childhood trauma and toxic stress\ninclude adverse childhood experiences, systemic racism, poverty, food and housing insecurity, and gender-based violence. The COVID-\n19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues and brought them into focus.\n\n(4) It is estimated that, overall, approximately 40% of children in this State have experienced at least one adverse childhood\nexperience and approximately 10% have experienced 3 or more adverse childhood experiences. However, the number of adverse\nchildhood experiences is higher for Black and Hispanic children who are growing up in poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified\nthe number of students who have experienced childhood trauma. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted preexisting inequities in\nschool disciplinary practices that disproportionately impact Black and Brown students. Research shows, for example, that girls of color\nare disproportionately impacted by trauma, adversity, and abuse, and instead of receiving the care and trauma-informed support they\nmay need, many Black girls in particular face disproportionately harsh disciplinary measures.\n\n(5) The cumulative effects of trauma and toxic stress adversely impact the physical health of students, as well as the students’ ability\nto learn, form relationships, and self-regulate. If left unaddressed, these effects increase a student's risk for depression, alcoholism,\nanxiety, asthma, smoking, and suicide, all of which are risks that disproportionately affect Black youth and may lead to a host of medical\ndiseases as an adult. Access to infant and early childhood mental health services is critical to ensure the social and emotional well-being\nof this State's youngest children, particularly those children who have experienced trauma.\n\n(6) Although this State enacted measures through Public Act 100-105 to address the high rate of early care and preschool\nexpulsions of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers and the disproportionately higher rate of expulsion for Black and Hispanic children, a\nrecent study found a wide variation in the awareness, understanding, and compliance with the law by providers of early childhood care.\nFurther work is needed to implement the law, which includes providing training to early childhood care providers to increase the\nproviders' understanding of the law, increasing the availability and access to infant and early childhood mental health services, and\nbuilding aligned data collection systems to better understand expulsion rates and to allow for accurate reporting as required by the law.\n\n(7) Many educators and schools in this State have embraced and implemented evidence-based restorative justice and trauma-\nresponsive and culturally relevant practices and interventions. However, the use of these interventions on students is often isolated or is\nimplemented occasionally and only if the school has the appropriate leadership, resources, and partners available to engage seriously in\nthis work. It would be malpractice to deny our students access to these practices and interventions, especially in the aftermath of a once-\nin-a-century pandemic.\n\n(b) The Whole Child Task Force created by Public Act 101-654 is reestablished for the purpose of establishing an equitable,\ninclusive, safe, and supportive environment in all schools for every student in this State. The task force shall have all of the following\ngoals, which means key steps have to be taken to ensure that every child in every school in this State has access to teachers, social\nworkers, school leaders, support personnel, and others who have been trained in evidence-based interventions and restorative\npractices:\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 222/510\n"", ""3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n(1) To create a common definition of a ttauma-responsive school, a trauma-responsive district, and a trauma-responsive community.\n(2) To outline the training and resources required to create and sustain a system of support for ttauma-responsive schools, districts,\nand communities and to identify this State's role in that work, including recommendations concerning options for redirecting resources\nfrom school resource officers to classroom-based support.\n\n(3) To identify or develop a process to conduct an analysis of the organizations that provide training in restorative practices, implicit\nbias, anti-racism, and trauma-responsive systems, mental health services, and social and emotional services to schools.\n\n(4) To provide recommendations concerning the key data to be collected and reported to ensure that this State has a full and\naccurate understanding of the progress toward ensuring that all schools, including programs and providers of care to pre-kindergarten\nchildren, employ restorative, anti-racist, and trauma-responsive strategies and practices. The data collected must include information\nrelating to the availability of trauma responsive support structures in schools, as well as disciplinary practices employed on students in\nperson or through other means, including during remote or blended learning. It should also include information on the use of and funding\nfor school resource officers and other similar police personnel in school programs.\n\n(5) To recommend an implementation timeline, including the key roles, responsibilities, and resources to advance this State toward a\nsystem in which every school, district, and community is progressing toward becoming trauma-responsive.\n\n(6) To seek input and feedback from stakeholders, including parents, students, and educators, who reflect the diversity of this State.\n\n(7) To recommend legislation, policies, and practices to prevent learning loss in students during periods of suspension and\nexpulsion, including, but not limited to, remote instruction.\n\n(c) Members of the Whole Child Task Force shall be appointed by the State Superintendent of Education.

If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the beginning of the following school term\nthrough February 1 of the following school term (unless a date later than February 1, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of\nthe following school term, is established in a collective bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming available must be\ntendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal due to one ""needs\nimprovement"" rating on either of the teacher\'s last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided that, if 2 ratings are available, the other\nperformance evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is ""satisfactory"", ""proficient"", or ""excellent"", and are qualified to hold the\npositions, based upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications established in a district or joint agreement job description, on or\nbefore the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 98-\n648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of honorable dismissal\noccurred during the 2013-2014 school year. Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding sentence, the order of recall\nmust be in inverse order of dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract\nbetween the board and a professional faculty members’ organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon\neconomic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years,\nwhichever is more, then the school board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, shall also hold a public hearing on the\nquestion of the dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote\nof the board members.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee described in\nsubsection (c) of this Section, a teacher\'s performance evaluation rating means the overall performance evaluation rating resulting from\nan annual or biennial performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of this Code by the school district or joint agreement\ndetermining the sequence of dismissal, not including any performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a remediation period.\nNo more than one evaluation rating each school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the purpose of determining the\nsequence of dismissal. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance evaluations conducted during or at the end\nof a remediation period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a school term, only the rating from the last evaluation\nconducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation rating from that\nschool term used for the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from multiple evaluations is not permitted\nunless otherwise agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a professional faculty members’\norganization. The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration that existing law does or does not already require that only one\nperformance evaluation each school term shall be used for the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For performance\nevaluation ratings determined prior to September 1, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a performance evaluation rating\nsystem that does not use either of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers\nmust establish a basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the\nperformance evaluation ratings that are to be used to determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher\'s grouping and ranking ona\nsequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a part of the teacher\'s performance evaluation, and that information shall be disclosed\nto the exclusive bargaining representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting\ndisclosure of such information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding\nthe pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has received at\nleast one performance evaluation rating conducted by the school district or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal and a\nsubsequent performance evaluation is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is required to be conducted under\nSection 24A-5 of this Code, the teacher\'s performance evaluation rating for that school year for purposes of determining the sequence of\ndismissal is deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health\nemergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not apply to any\nteacher who has entered into contractual continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her most recent evaluation. During\nany time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency\nManagement Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive bargaining representative have completed the performance\nrating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate performance rating, any teacher who has entered into contractual continued\nservice, whose most recent evaluation was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not conducted when the evaluation\nis required to be conducted shall receive a teacher\'s performance rating deemed Excellent. A school board and any exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative may mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers not in contractual continued service during any time in\nwhich the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency\nManagement Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing.

The\nhearing officer must permit the teacher to submit all relevant questions and follow-up questions for such a witness to have the questions\nposed by the hearing officer. All questions must exclude evidence of the witness\' sexual behavior or predisposition, unless the evidence\nis offered to prove that someone other than the teacher subject to the dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue.\n\n(7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, whichever is later, make a\ndecision as to whether or not the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or report to the school board findings of\nfact and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the decision or\nfindings of fact and recommendation to both the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer fails without good cause, specifically\nprovided in writing to both parties and the State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within\n30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may mutually agree to select a hearing\nofficer pursuant to the alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed to\nrender a decision or findings of fact and recommendation or to review the record and render a decision.

In the event such\nreview is instituted, the school board shall be responsible for preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such costs associated\ntherewith must be divided equally between the parties.\n\n(10) If a decision of the hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the school board for dismissal for\ncause is adjudicated upon review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the\nmatter to the school board with direction for entry of an order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation. The\nteacher may challenge the school board\'s order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an\nexpedited arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator borne by the school board.\n\nAny teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned by the board to a position\nsubstantially similar to the one which that teacher held prior to that teacher\'s suspension or dismissal.\n\n(11) Subject to any later effective date referenced in this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal process, the changes made by\nPublic Act 97-8 shall apply to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011.

It is the intent of the General Assembly to\nprovide adequate reimbursement for ambulance services so as to ensure adequate access to services for recipients of aid under this\nArticle and to provide appropriate incentives to ambulance service providers to provide services in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nThus, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the Illinois Department implement a reimbursement system for ambulance services\nthat, to the extent practicable and subject to the availability of funds appropriated by the General Assembly for this purpose, is consistent\nwith the payment principles of Medicare. To ensure uniformity between the payment principles of Medicare and Medicaid, the Illinois\nDepartment shall follow, to the extent necessary and practicable and subject to the availability of funds appropriated by the General\nAssembly for this purpose, the statutes, laws, regulations, policies, procedures, principles, definitions, guidelines, and manuals used to\ndetermine the amounts paid to ambulance service providers under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare).\n\n(b) For ambulance services provided to a recipient of aid under this Article on or after January 1, 1996, the Illinois Department shall\nreimburse ambulance service providers based upon the actual distance traveled if a natural disaster, weather conditions, road repairs, or\ntraffic congestion necessitates the use of a route other than the most direct route.\n\n(c) For purposes of this Section, ""ambulance services"" includes medical transportation services provided by means of an\nambulance, air ambulance, medi-car, service car, or taxi.\n\n(c-1) For purposes of this Section, ""ground ambulance service"" means medical transportation services that are described as ground\nambulance services by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and provided in a vehicle that is licensed as an ambulance by\nthe Illinois Department of Public Health pursuant to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act.\n\n(c-2) For purposes of this Section, ""ground ambulance service provider"" means a vehicle service provider as described in the\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act that operates licensed ambulances for the purpose of providing emergency ambulance\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 300/510\n', '3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n\nservices, or non-emergency ambulance services, or both.

The provider must maintain this certification in its\nrecords. The provider shall produce such documentation upon demand by the Department or its representative. Failure to produce\ndocumentation of such training shall result in recovery of any payments made by the Department for services rendered by a non-certified\ndriver or employee attendant. Medi-car and service car providers must maintain legible documentation in their records of the driver and,\nas applicable, employee attendant that actually transported the patient. Providers must recertify all drivers and employee attendants\nevery 3 years. If they meet the established training components set forth by the Department, providers of non-emergency medi-car and\nservice car transportation that are either directly or through an affiliated company licensed by the Department of Public Health shall be\napproved by the Department to have in-house safety programs for training their own staff.\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements above, any public transportation provider of medi-car and service car transportation that receives\nfederal funding under 49 U.S.C. 5307 and 5311 need not certify its drivers and employee attendants under this Section, since safety\ntraining is already federally mandated.\n\n(f) With respect to any policy or program administered by the Department or its agent regarding approval of non-emergency medical\ntransportation by ground ambulance service providers, including, but not limited to, the Non-Emergency Transportation Services Prior\nApproval Program (NETSPAP), the Department shall establish by rule a process by which ground ambulance service providers of non-\nemergency medical transportation may appeal any decision by the Department or its agent for which no denial was received prior to the\ntime of transport that either (i) denies a request for approval for payment of non-emergency transportation by means of ground\nambulance service or (ii) grants a request for approval of non-emergency transportation by means of ground ambulance service at a\nlevel of service that entitles the ground ambulance service provider to a lower level of compensation from the Department than the\nground ambulance service provider would have received as compensation for the level of service requested. The rule shall be filed by\nDecember 15, 2012 and shall provide that, for any decision rendered by the Department or its agent on or after the date the rule takes\neffect, the ground ambulance service provider shall have 60 days from the date the decision is received to file an appeal. The rule\nestablished by the Department shall be, insofar as is practical, consistent with the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. The Director\'s\ndecision on an appeal under this Section shall be a final administrative decision subject to review under the Administrative Review Law.\n\n(f-5) Beginning 90 days after July 20, 2012 (the effective date of Public Act 97-842), (i) no denial of a request for approval for\npayment of non-emergency transportation by means of ground ambulance service, and (ii) no approval of non-emergency transportation\nby means of ground ambulance service at a level of service that entitles the ground ambulance service provider to a lower level of\ncompensation from the Department than would have been received at the level of service submitted by the ground ambulance service\nprovider, may be issued by the Department or its agent unless the Department has submitted the criteria for determining the\nappropriateness of the transport for first notice publication in the Illinois Register pursuant to Section 5-40 of the Illinois Administrative\nProcedure Act.\n\n(f-6) Within 90 days after June 2, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 102-1037) this-amendatery Act eHhe4 62nd -Generat\nAssembly and subject to federal approval, the Department shall file rules to allow for the approval of ground ambulance services when\nthe sole purpose of the transport is for the navigation of stairs or the assisting or lifting of a patient at a medical facility or during a\nmedical appointment in instances where the Department or a contracted Medicaid managed care organization or their transportation\nbroker is unable to secure transportation through any other transportation provider.\n\n(f-7) For non-emergency ground ambulance claims properly denied under Department policy at the time the claim is filed due to\nfailure to submit a valid Medical Certification for Non-Emergency Ambulance on and after December 15, 2012 and prior to January 1,\n2021, the Department shall allot $2,000,000 to a pool to reimburse such claims if the provider proves medical necessity for the service\nby other means. Providers must submit any such denied claims for which they seek compensation to the Department no later than\nDecember 31, 2021 along with documentation of medical necessity. No later than May 31, 2022, the Department shall determine for\nwhich claims medical necessity was established. Such claims for which medical necessity was established shall be paid at the rate in\neffect at the time of the service, provided the $2,000,000 is sufficient to pay at those rates. If the pool is not sufficient, claims shall be\npaid at a uniform percentage of the applicable rate such that the pool of $2,000,000 is exhausted. The appeal process described in\nsubsection (f) shall not be applicable to the Department\'s determinations made in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(g) Whenever a patient covered by a medical assistance program under this Code or by another medical program administered by\nthe Department, including a patient covered under the State\'s Medicaid managed care program, is being transported from a facility and\nrequires non-emergency transportation including ground ambulance, medi-car, or service car transportation, a Physician Certification\nStatement as described in this Section shall be required for each patient.

This\ncertification shall be completed prior to ordering the transportation service and prior to patient discharge. The Physician Certification\nStatement is not required prior to transport if a delay in transport can be expected to negatively affect the patient outcome. If the ground\nambulance provider, medi-car provider, or service car provider is unable to obtain the required Physician Certification Statement within\n10 calendar days following the date of the service, the ground ambulance provider, medi-car provider, or service car provider must\ndocument its attempt to obtain the requested certification and may then submit the claim for payment. Acceptable documentation\nincludes a signed return receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, facsimile receipt, email receipt, or other similar service that evidences that\nthe ground ambulance provider, medi-car provider, or service car provider attempted to obtain the required Physician Certification\nStatement.\n\nThe medical certification specifying the level and type of non-emergency transportation needed shall be in the form of the Physician\nCertification Statement on a standardized form prescribed by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Within 75 days after\nJuly 27, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-646), the Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall develop a standardized\nform of the Physician Certification Statement specifying the level and type of transportation services needed in consultation with the\nDepartment of Public Health, Medicaid managed care organizations, a statewide association representing ambulance providers, a\nstatewide association representing hospitals, 3 statewide associations representing nursing homes, and other stakeholders. The\nPhysician Certification Statement shall include, but is not limited to, the criteria necessary to demonstrate medical necessity for the level\nof transport needed as required by (i) the Department of Healthcare and Family Services and (ii) the federal Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services as outlined in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\' Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. 100-02, Chap.\n10, Sec. 10.2.1, et seq.

Implementation and acceptance of\nthe Physician Certification Statement shall take place no later than 90 days after the issuance of the Physician Certification Statement by\nthe Department of Healthcare and Family Services.\n\nPursuant to subsection (E) of Section 12-4.25 of this Code, the Department is entitled to recover overpayments paid to a provider or\nvendor, including, but not limited to, from the discharging physician, the discharging facility, and the ground ambulance service provider,\nin instances where a non-emergency ground ambulance service is rendered as the result of improper or false certification.\n\nBeginning October 1, 2018, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall collect data from Medicaid managed care\norganizations and transportation brokers, including the Department\'s NETSPAP broker, regarding denials and appeals related to the\nmissing or incomplete Physician Certification Statement forms and overall compliance with this subsection. The Department of\nHealthcare and Family Services shall publish quarterly results on its website within 15 days following the end of each quarter.\n\n(h) On and after July 1, 2012, the Department shall reduce any rate of reimbursement for services or other payments or alter any\nmethodologies authorized by this Code to reduce any rate of reimbursement for services or other payments in accordance with Section\n5-5e.\n\n(i) Subject to federal approval, on and after January 1, 2024 through June 30, 2026, the Department shall increase the base rate of\nreimbursement for both base charges and mileage charges for ground ambulance service providers not participating in the Ground\nEmergency Medical Transportation (GEMT) Program for medical transportation services provided by means of a ground ambulance to a\nlevel not lower than 140% of the base rate in effect as of January 1, 2023.\n\n(j) For the purpose of understanding ground ambulance transportation services cost structures and their impact on the Medical\nAssistance Program, the Department shall engage stakeholders, including, but not limited to, a statewide association representing\nprivate ground ambulance service providers in Illinois, to develop recommendations for a plan for the regular collection of cost data for all\nground ambulance transportation providers reimbursed under the Illinois Title XIX State Plan. Cost data obtained through this process\nshall be used to inform on and to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Illinois Medicaid rates.

Implementation of Medicare\'s Patient-Driven\nPayment Model shall, by September 1, 2020, end the collection of the MDS data that is necessary to maintain the current RUG-IV\nMedicaid payment methodology. The technical advisory group must consider a revised reimbursement methodology that takes into\naccount transparency, accountability, actual staffing as reported under the federally required Payroll Based Journal system, changes to\nthe minimum wage, adequacy in coverage of the cost of care, and a quality component that rewards quality improvements.\n\n(|) The Department shall establish per diem add-on payments to improve the quality of care delivered by facilities, including:\n\n(1) Incentive payments determined by facility performance on specified quality measures in an initial amount of $70,000,000.\nNothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the quality of care payments in the aggregate statewide to $70,000,000, and, if\nquality of care has improved across nursing facilities, the Department shall adjust those add-on payments accordingly. The quality\npayment methodology described in this subsection must be used for at least State Fiscal Year 2023. Beginning with the quarter starting\nJuly 1, 2023, the Department may add, remove, or change quality metrics and make associated changes to the quality payment\nmethodology as outlined in subparagraph (E). Facilities designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a special\nfocus facility or a hospital-based nursing home do not qualify for quality payments.\n\n(A) Each quality pool must be distributed by assigning a quality weighted score for each nursing home which is calculated by\nmultiplying the nursing home\'s quality base period Medicaid days by the nursing home\'s star rating weight in that period.\n\n(B) Star rating weights are assigned based on the nursing home\'s star rating for the LTS quality star rating. As used in this\nsubparagraph, ""LTS quality star rating"" means the long-term stay quality rating for each nursing facility, as assigned by the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services under the Five-Star Quality Rating System. The rating is a number ranging from 0 (lowest) to 5\n(highest).\n\n(i) Zero-star or one-star rating has a weight of 0.\n(ii) Two-star rating has a weight of 0.75.\n\n(iii) Three-star rating has a weight of 1.5.\n\n(iv) Four-star rating has a weight of 2.5.\n\n(v) Five-star rating has a weight of 3.5.\n\n(C) Each nursing home\'s quality weight score is divided by the sum of all quality weight scores for qualifying nursing homes to\ndetermine the proportion of the quality pool to be paid to the nursing home.\n\n(D) The quality pool is no less than $70,000,000 annually or $17,500,000 per quarter. The Department shall publish on its website\nthe estimated payments and the associated weights for each facility 45 days prior to when the initial payments for the quarter are to be\npaid. The Department shall assign each facility the most recent and applicable quarter\'s STAR value unless the facility notifies the\nDepartment within 15 days of an issue and the facility provides reasonable evidence demonstrating its timely compliance with federal\ndata submission requirements for the quarter of record. If such evidence cannot be provided to the Department, the STAR rating\nassigned to the facility shall be reduced by one from the prior quarter.\n\n(E) The Department shall review quality metrics used for payment of the quality pool and make recommendations for any associated\nchanges to the methodology for distributing quality pool payments in consultation with associations representing long-term care\nproviders, consumer advocates, organizations representing workers of long-term care facilities, and payors. The Department may\nestablish, by rule, changes to the methodology for distributing quality pool payments.\n\n(F) The Department shall disburse quality pool payments from the Long-Term Care Provider Fund on a monthly basis in amounts\nproportional to the total quality pool payment determined for the quarter.\n\nhttps://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&id=ID:bill:IL2023000H4844 &verid=IL2023000H4844_20240701_0 E& 314/510\n', '3/31/25, 5:35 PM Bill Resource\n\n(G) The Department shall publish any changes in the methodology for distributing quality pool payments prior to the beginning of the\nmeasurement period or quality base period for any metric added to the distribution\'s methodology.\n\n(2) Payments based on CNA tenure, promotion, and CNA training for the purpose of increasing CNA compensation. It is the intent of\nthis subsection that payments made in accordance with this paragraph be directly incorporated into increased compensation for CNAs.\nAs used in this paragraph, ""CNA"" means a certified nursing assistant as that term is described in Section 3-206 of the Nursing Home\nCare Act, Section 3-206 of the |D/DD Community Care Act, and Section 3-206 of the MC/DD Act. The Department shall establish, by\nrule, payments to nursing facilities equal to Medicaid\'s share of the tenure wage increments specified in this paragraph for all reported\nCNA employee hours compensated according to a posted schedule consisting of increments at least as large as those specified in this\nparagraph. The increments are as follows: an additional $1.50 per hour for CNAs with at least one and less than 2 years\' experience plus\nanother $1 per hour for each additional year of experience up to a maximum of $6.50 for CNAs with at least 6 years of experience. For\npurposes of this paragraph, Medicaid\'s share shall be the ratio determined by paid Medicaid bed days divided by total bed days for the\napplicable time period used in the calculation. In addition, and additive to any tenure increments paid as specified in this paragraph, the\nDepartment shall establish, by rule, payments supporting Medicaid\'s share of the promotion-based wage increments for CNA employee\nhours compensated for that promotion with at least a $1.50 hourly increase. Medicaid\'s share shall be established as it is for the tenure\nincrements described in this paragraph. Qualifying promotions shall be defined by the Department in rules for an expected 10-15%\nsubset of CNAs assigned intermediate, specialized, or added roles such as CNA trainers, CNA scheduling ""captains"", and CNA\nspecialists for resident conditions like dementia or memory care or behavioral health.\n\n(m) The Department shall work with nursing facility industry representatives to design policies and procedures to permit facilities to\naddress the integrity of data from federal reporting sites used by the Department in setting facility rates.\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-77, eff. 7-9-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-1035, eff. 5-31-22; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23; 103-102, Article 40, Section 40-5,\neff. 1-1-24; 103-102, Article 50, Section 50-5, eff. 1-1-24; revised 12-15-23.)\n\n(305 ILCS 5/5-16.8)\n\nSec. 5-16.8.

The parent-child visiting plan shall set out the time and place of\nvisits, the frequency of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to\nhave telephone and mail communication with the parents.\n\nWhere the Department of Children and Family Services Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive temporary\ncustodian, and when the child has siblings in care, the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with the court and serve on\nthe parties a sibling placement and contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the appointment. The sibling\nplacement and contact plan shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and if they are not placed together, what, if any,\nefforts are being made to place them together. If the Department has determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be placed with a\nsibling, the Department shall document in the sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. For siblings placed\nseparately, the sibling placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits,\nwho shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in addition to in\nperson contact. If the Department determines it is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a sibling, the Department shall\ndocument in the sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify\na date for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family Services Act,\nand shall remain in effect until the Sibling Contact Support Plan is developed.\n\nFor good cause, the court may waive the requirement to file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement and contact plan,\nor extend the time for filing either plan. Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan to determine\nwhether it is reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, request\nthe court to review the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it is consistent with the\nminor's best interest. The court may refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, duration, and locations of visitation\nshall be measured by the needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of Department personnel. Child development\nprinciples shall be considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should\ntake place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the court\ndetermines that the parent-child visiting plan is not reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the achievement of the permanency\ngoal or that the restrictions placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact are contrary to the child's best interests, the\ncourt shall put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination and enter specific findings based on the evidence.

Nothing in this subsection (2) shall restrict the\nDepartment from immediately restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling contacts, without either amending the parent-child\nvisiting plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there is an\nimmediate need to protect the child's health, safety, and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based on available facts to\nthe Department and its assigns when viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall only occur on an individual case-by-\ncase basis. The Department shall file with the court and serve on the parties any amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding\nweekends and holidays, of the change of the visitation.\n\nAcceptance of services shall not be considered an admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to this Act, nor may a\nreferral of services be considered as evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where the issue is whether the Department\nhas made reasonable efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of\nthe minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings concerning the immediate\nand urgent necessity for the protection of the minor or of the person or property of another and (ii) the factual basis supporting its\nfindings that reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts\nreasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, custodian,\ntemporary custodian, and minor shall each be furnished a copy of such written findings.

Absence of minor.\n\n(1) When a minor after arrest and an initial court appearance for a felony, fails to appear for trial, at the request of the State and after\nthe State has affirmatively proven through substantial evidence that the minor is willfully avoiding trial, the court may commence trial in\nthe absence of the minor. The absent minor must be represented by retained or appointed counsel. If trial had previously commenced in\nthe presence of the minor and the minor is willfully absent for 2 successive court days, the court shall proceed to trial. All procedural\nrights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, Constitution of the State of Illinois, statutes of the State of Illinois, and rules of court\nshall apply to the proceedings the same as if the minor were present in court. The court may set the case for a trial which may be\nconducted under this Section despite the failure of the minor to appear at the hearing at which the trial date is set. When the trial date is\nset, the clerk shall send to the minor, by certified mail at the minor\'s last known address, notice of the new date which has been set for\ntrial. The notification shall be required when the minor was not personally present in open court at the time when the case was set for\ntrial.\n\n(2) The absence of the minor from a trial conducted under this Section does not operate as a bar to concluding the trial, to a finding\nof guilty resulting from the trial, or to a final disposition of the trial in favor of the minor.\n\n(3) Upon a finding or verdict of not guilty, the court shall enter a finding for the minor. Upon a finding or verdict of guilty, the court\nshall set a date for the hearing of post-trial motions and shall hear the motion in the absence of the minor. If post-trial motions are\ndenied, the court shall proceed to conduct a sentencing hearing and to impose a sentence upon the minor. A social investigation is\nwaived if the minor is absent.\n\n(4) Aminor who is absent for part of the proceedings of trial, post-trial motions, or sentencing, does not thereby forfeit the minor\'s\nright to be present at all remaining proceedings.\n\n(5) When a minor who in the minor\'s absence has been either found guilty or sentenced or both found guilty and sentenced appears\nbefore the court, the minor must be granted a new trial or a new sentencing hearing if the minor can establish that the minor\'s failure to\nappear in court was both without the minor\'s fault and due to circumstances beyond the minor\'s control. A hearing with notice to the\nState\'s Attorney on the minors request for a new trial or a new sentencing hearing must be held before any such request may be\ngranted. At any such hearing both the minor and the State may present evidence.\n\n(6) If the court grants only the minor\'s request for a new sentencing hearing, then a new sentencing hearing shall be held in\naccordance with the provisions of this Article. At any such hearing, both the minor and the State may offer evidence of the minor\'s\nconduct during the minor\'s period of absence from the court. The court may impose any sentence authorized by this Article and in the\ncase of an extended juvenile jurisdiction prosecution the Unified Code of Corrections and is not in any way limited or restricted by any\nsentence previously imposed.\n\n(7) Aminor whose motion under subsection (5) for a new trial or new sentencing hearing has been denied may file a notice of\nappeal from the denial.

Sentencing hearing; evidence; continuance.\n\n(1) In this subsection (1), ""violent crime"" has the same meaning ascribed to the term in subsection (c) of Section 3 of the Rights of\nCrime Victims and Witnesses Act. At the sentencing hearing, the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the minor or\nthe public that the minor be made a ward of the court, and, if the minor is to be made a ward of the court, the court shall determine the\nproper disposition best serving the interests of the minor and the public. All evidence helpful in determining these questions, including\noral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value, even though not competent for the\npurposes of the trial. A crime victim shall be allowed to present an oral or written statement, as guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the\nIllinois Constitution and as provided in Section 6 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, in any case in which: (a) a juvenile\nhas been adjudicated delinquent for a violent crime after a bench or jury trial; or (b) the petition alleged the commission of a violent crime\nand the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent under a plea agreement of a crime that is not a violent crime. The court shall allow a\nvictim to make an oral statement if the victim is present in the courtroom and requests to make an oral statement. An oral statement\nincludes the victim or a representative of the victim reading the written statement. The court may allow persons impacted by the crime\nwho are not victims under subsection (a) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act to present an oral or written\nstatement. A victim and any person making an oral statement shall not be put under oath or subject to cross-examination. A record of a\nprior continuance under supervision under Section 5-615, whether successfully completed or not, is admissible at the sentencing\nhearing. No order of commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice shall be entered against a minor before a written report of social\ninvestigation, which has been completed within the previous 60 days, is presented to and considered by the court.\n\n(2) Once a party has been served in compliance with Section 5-525, no further service or notice must be given to that party prior to\nproceeding to a sentencing hearing. Before imposing sentence the court shall advise the State\'s Attorney and the parties who are\npresent or their counsel of the factual contents and the conclusions of the reports prepared for the use of the court and considered by it,\nand afford fair opportunity, if requested, to controvert them. Factual contents, conclusions, documents and sources disclosed by the court\nunder this paragraph shall not be further disclosed without the express approval of the court.\n\n(3) On its own motion or that of the State\'s Attorney, a parent, guardian, legal custodian, or counsel, the court may adjourn the\nhearing for a reasonable period to receive reports or other evidence and, in such event, shall make an appropriate order for detention of\nthe minor or the minor\'s release from detention subject to supervision by the court during the period of the continuance. In the event the\ncourt shall order detention hereunder, the period of the continuance shall not exceed 30 court days. At the end of such time, the court\nshall release the minor from detention unless notice is served at least 3 days prior to the hearing on the continued date that the State will\nbe seeking an extension of the period of detention, which notice shall state the reason for the request for the extension. The extension of\ndetention may be for a maximum period of an additional 15 court days or a lesser number of days at the discretion of the court. However,\nat the expiration of the period of extension, the court shall release the minor from detention if a further continuance is granted. In\nscheduling investigations and hearings, the court shall give priority to proceedings in which a minor is in detention or has otherwise been\nremoved from the minor\'s home before a sentencing order has been made.\n\n(4) When commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice is ordered, the court shall state the basis for selecting the particular\ndisposition, and the court shall prepare such a statement for inclusion in the record.\n\n(5) Before a sentencing order is entered by the court under Section 5-710 for a minor adjudged delinquent for a violation of\nparagraph (3.5) of subsection (a) of Section 26-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012, in which the minor made a threat of violence, death, or\nbodily harm against a person, school, school function, or school event, the court may order a mental health evaluation of the minor by a\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or qualified examiner, whether employed by the State, by any public or private mental health facility or\npart of the facility, or by any public or private medical facility or part of the facility. A statement made by a minor during the course of a\nmental health evaluation conducted under this subsection (5) is not admissible on the issue of delinquency during the course of an\nadjudicatory hearing held under this Act.

Employers shall provide employees with written\nnotice of changes to the employer's vacation time, paid time off, or other paid leave policies that affect an employee's right to final\ncompensation for such leave.\n\n(m) During any period an employee takes leave under this Act, the employer shall maintain coverage for the employee and any\nfamily member under any group health plan for the duration of such leave at no less than the level and conditions of coverage that would\nhave been provided if the employee had not taken the leave. The employer shall notify the employee that the employee is still\nresponsible for paying the employee's share of the cost of the health care coverage, if any.\n\n(n) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, impede, or in any way diminish the right of employees to bargain collectively\nwith their employers through representatives of their own choosing in order to establish wages or other conditions of work in excess of\nthe applicable minimum standards established in this Act.

Argumentacion\n\nConforme las definiciones internacionales generalmente aceptadas, la\ninteligencia artificial implica el uso de tecnologias de la informacién que ejecutan\noperaciones comparables a las que realiza la mente humana. Los sistemas de\ninteligencia artificial (SIA) estan en constante evolucién y en muy corto tiempo\nhan generado multiples beneficios, tanto econédmicos como sociales, pero\ntambién enormes retos para las sociedades y los gobiernos.\n\nEn efecto, se ha identificado que los elementos y técnicas utilizados por la\ninteligencia artificial pueden generar riesgos o consecuencias negativas para\npersonas, grupos vulnerables o ciertos sectores de la poblacién. Es por ello que\nresulta indispensable establecer reglas claras que, por un lado, permitan su\ndesarrollo e implementacién, pero por el otro ayuden a mitigar los riesgos\nderivados de su aplicaci6n.\n\nDada su reciente creacion y su constante evolucién, a nivel mundial existe una\nregulacion poco desarrollada al respecto. No obstante, se identificd que la Union\nEuropea y Estados Unidos de América cuentan con legislacién al respecto.\nAdemas, existen proyectos normativos en tramite en Brasil y Chile.\n\nAdicionalmente, organismos multilaterales, como la ONU o la OCDE, han emitido\nrecomendaciones para una posible regulacién de la Inteligencia Artificial, sin\nembargo, dichos documentos no son vinculantes para los paises miembros de\nesos organismos internacionales.\n\nLos alcances de la legislacién existente, o en proceso de formacidn, difieren\ndependiendo de cada regi6n y pais, sin embargo, en los casos de mayor avance\n', 'zZ\nPLegisus®\n\nG Lxv Legis\n\nse pretende abarcar y regular los diversos usos que se le da a la inteligencia\nartificial para mitigar riesgos e imponer obligaciones claras a los proveedores y\nusuarios a fin de evitar el mal uso de ésta en perjuicio de la poblacion.\n\nNuestro pais no es ajeno a la llegada e implementaciédn de las nuevas\ntecnologias de la informacion, incluidos los SIA. Para México, la implementacién\nde estos sistemas de manera generalizada puede ayudar a crear oportunidades\nde desarrollo y mejores servicios para la poblacién, asi como para elevar la\nproductividad en diversos sectores econdmicos y fomentar el crecimiento y la\ngeneracidn de oportunidades de trabajo.\n\nLa presente iniciativa pretende dar paso a la creacién en México del primer\nmarco juridico en materia de sistemas de inteligencia artificial, que por un lado\npermita a nuestro pais aprovechar los beneficios que presenta su utilizacién en\nlos diversos campos de su aplicacién, mientras que por el otro se protejan los\nderechos de terceros, de los usuarios y del publico en general.\n\nEntre los usos de los SIA que esta iniciativa pretende regular se encuentran la\nidentificacién biométrica y categorizacidén de personas fisicas; la generacién de\nimagenes, sonidos 0 videos; la creacién de documentos legales y el uso de los\nSIA por agencias gubernamentales para el otorgamiento de beneficios de\nprogramas sociales, la aplicacién de la ley, la gesti6n de migracidn, asilo y control\nde fronteras y la administracién de justicia, asi como la proteccién de la\npropiedad intelectual, ya sea que se trate de obras artisticas o contenido\ngenerado por periodistas o por empresas de medios dedicadas a esa actividad.\n\nPara la elaboracién de la iniciativa se tomaron como base los precedentes\nnormativos en materia de SIA, particularmente el Reglamento de la Unidén\nEuropea sobre Inteligencia Artificial’. Asimismo, por su identidad cultural con\nnuestro pais, se tomé en consideracién un proyecto de ley que esta en curso\nlegislativo en Chile. Por la universalidad alcanzada por el desarrollo cientifico y\ntecnoldgico las normas juridicas que regulan o inciden en esos campos tienen\nde manera necesaria la misma condicién de universalidad. Por ello, en el\narticulado del proyecto de ley que contiene esta iniciativa se han recuperado\ntextos normativos de los marcos juridicos antes mencionados, adaptandolos a\nnuestro marco juridico.\n\n1 Reglamento del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo por el que se Establecen Normas\nArmonizadas en Materia de Inteligencia Artificial.

Se trata de acuerdos en los que\nambas partes definieron los términos y alcances de una compensaci6én\necondémica que OpenAl y Microsoft pagaran por el uso de ese contenido para\nfines del entrenamiento de su robot ChatGPT y sus distintas versiones.\n\nSin embargo, asi como hubo las condiciones para lograr algunos acuerdos como\nlos referidos anteriormente, también hay casos en los que no se ha podido lograr\nun acuerdo entre las partes. Por ello resulta indispensable introducir en el marco\nlegal disposiciones que protejan el esfuerzo creativo de periodistas, columnistas,\neditores, caricaturistas, entre otros, para que las grandes empresas tecnolégicas\nque pretendan utilizar el contenido periodistico referido, estén obligadas a lograr\nacuerdos con los titulares de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de ese\ncontenido, previo a intentar utilizar este para fines de entrenamiento de sus\nrespectivas soluciones o herramientas de Inteligencia Artificial, o incluso para\nfines de explotacién de esa obra.\n\nLo mismo debe preverse para el caso de los artistas, cuya obra audiovisual,\ncomo pueden ser pinturas, fotografia, libros, musica 0 videos, pueda ser utilizada\npara fines de entrenamiento de los algoritmos basados en Inteligencia Artificial,\n\n3“The New York Times demanda a OpenAl y Microsoft por el uso de obras con derechos de autor\nen la IA’, 27 diciembre-2023.

El enfoque de\nriesgos permite dotar de flexibilidad a la legislaci6n que se emita, como un primer\npaso en un campo que conocera un acelerado desarrollo en el futuro inmediato.\n\nIl. Contenido de Ia Iniciativa\n\nEn la iniciativa de ley que someto a consideracién de esta Soberania se\nestablecen las bases para la regulacién del desarrollo, comercializacién y uso de\nlos SIA bajo un enfoque de riesgos, para que, por un lado, se incentive el uso de\nla inteligencia artificial, mientras que por el otro se eviten o reduzcan los posibles\nefectos nocivos que puede generar.\n\nCon la legislacién que se propone se busca que el uso de Ia inteligencia artificial\nse realice de manera ética y responsable a fin de evitar un mal uso de estas\ntecnologias. Por ejemplo, los desarrolladores y usuarios deberan ser\nresponsables sobre el contenido de los materiales que crean o difunden; ademas\ndeberan evitar y denunciar la propagacion de discursos de odio, de incitacién a\nla violencia y de noticias falsas. El uso irresponsable de los SIA puede generar\nnuevas formas de discriminacién hacia diversos sectores en condiciones de\nvulnerabilidad.\n\nEn linea con las mejores regulaciones de la Unidn Europea, esta iniciativa\npropone regular el uso de la inteligencia artificial bajo un enfoque de riesgos. Con\nello se pretende dotar a la legislacién de flexibilidad a fin de mantener su vigencia\naun con los acelerados cambios tecnolégicos, ademas de evitar y sancionar los\nposibles efectos nocivos a la sociedad por el uso de los SIA.\n\nEn esa direcci6n, la legislaci6n propuesta tiene varios objetivos; por un lado,\nregular el uso de la inteligencia artificial y por el otro garantizar el respeto a los\nderechos humanos y evitar la discriminaciédn con el uso de la misma.\n\nPara garantizar la maxima transparencia y evitar o reducir al minimo los riesgos\npara la salud, la seguridad publica o el respeto a los derechos humanos por el\nuso de la inteligencia artificial, la iniciativa prevé que los desarrolladores y\n', 'zZ G\n2 =\nPLegisus®\n\nproveedores de los SIA garanticen que dichos sistemas puedan ser vigilados por\nla autoridad competente, con participaci6n humana en esa vigilancia.\n\nAsimismo, la iniciativa establece reglas de transparencia para evitar el “deep\nfake” (ultra falsificaciones); para ello, se establece que quienes generen o\nmanipulen, mediante inteligencia artificial, imagenes, sonidos 0 videos que se\nasemejen a personas o lugares reales deberan sefalar que el contenido fue\nmodificado usando los SIA. También se establecen reglas para garantizar los\nderechos de autor y propiedad intelectual, como la obligacién de que los\ndesarrolladores o proveedores de sistemas de inteligencia artificial deban\nalcanzar acuerdos con los titulares de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de\ninformacion o contenido que pretendan utilizar para entrenar sus algoritmos de\ninteligencia artificial. Para ello, se prevé dotar de atribuciones al Instituto Federal\nde Telecomunicaciones para que pueda resolver cualquier desacuerdo sobre los\ntérminos y condiciones que no hubieran podido ser convenidos entre las partes,\nde forma similar a la forma en que debe resolver los desacuerdos entre\nconcesionarios de redes publicas de telecomunicaciones.\n\nCabe apuntar que, dado que los SIA forman parte de las tecnologias de la\ninformacion, incluidas en el sector de las telecomunicaciones, la iniciativa prevé\nasignar al Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones la funcién de autoridad\ncompetente en materia de inteligencia artificial.\n\nAsimismo, para la mejor proteccién de los derechos humanos de los usuarios de\nlos SIA la iniciativa prevé la creacién de una Comisién Nacional de Inteligencia\nArtificial, como organo consultivo del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones.\nLa Comisi6n se integrara por cinco cientificos de reconocido prestigio en materia\nde desarrollo tecnolégico y tecnologias de la informacién y su participacién\ntendra caracter honorifico.\n\nA efecto de prever escenarios de incumplimiento de las obligaciones previstas\nen esta nueva legislacién se prevé la posibilidad de que el Instituto Federal de\nTelecomunicaciones pueda imponer multas a quienes infrinjan las disposiciones\ncontenidas en esta ley, que para que puedan tener efectividad, se propone se\ndefinan en términos de una proporcidn de los ingresos del 0 los infractores. Lo\nanterior, porque se trata de un ecosistema en el que participan agentes\necondémicos de gran tamafio y de gran poder econdémico que ante cualquier multa\ndefinida en términos absolutos o montos predeterminados, no enfrentaran el\nincentivo adecuado para dejar de infringir el marco legal. Por ello, también se\nprevé que para casos de reincidencia, se pueda imponer una multa de hasta el\ndoble de lo previsto para el caso de una primera infraccion.\n', 'Senado\n\nmorena\n\nzZ G\n2 =\nPLegisus®\n\nEn el régimen transitorio, ademas de disponerse lo necesario para la entrada en\nvigor de la nueva ley, se propone fijar al Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones\nun plazo de seis meses para emitir la regulaci6n secundaria que considere\nnecesaria, previa designacién de los cinco integrantes de la Comisién Nacional\nde Inteligencia Artificial, a quienes se asigna la facultad de proponer al pleno del\nInstituto el o los anteproyectos de dicha regulacion, para lo cual deberan contar\ncon el respaldo de todas las autoridades federales con intervencién en esta\ndelicada materia, empezando por la Secretaria de _ Infraestructura,\nComunicaciones y Transportes.\n\nPor lo antes expuesto, presento a esta Soberania el siguiente:\n\nPROYECTO DE DECRETO\n\nCon base en las razones expuestas, con fundamento en lo dispuesto por los\narticulos 71, fraccidn Il, y 72 de la Constitucién Politica de los Estados Unidos\nMexicanos, asi como por los articulos 8, numeral 1, fraccién | y 164 del\nReglamento del Senado de la Republica, se somete a la consideracién de esta\nHonorable Asamblea la siguiente iniciativa con:\n\nPROYECTO DE DECRETO POR EL QUE SE EXPIDE LEY FEDERAL QUE\nREGULA LA INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL.\n\nArticulo Unico.

VANEL -- read once and referred to the Committee on Science and Technology\n\nAN ACT to amend the state technology law, in relation to enacting the New York artificial intelligence bill of rights\n\nThe People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:\nSection 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the ""New York artificial intelligence bill of rights"".\n\nSection 2. Legislative intent. This legislature hereby finds that this generation of humans is the first in history to have the ability to create\ntechnologies that can make decisions which previously could have only been made by humans. States and countries across the world are\ngrappling with critical questions of how we can use these technologies to solve our problems, how we can avoid or manage the new\nproblems that these technologies may create, and how we can control these powerful technologies.\n\nTherefore, the legislature declares that any New York resident affected by any system making decisions without human intervention be\nentitled to certain rights and protections to ensure that the system impacting their lives do so lawfully, properly, and with meaningful oversight.\n\nAmong these rights and protections are (i) the right to safe and effective systems; (ii) protections against algorithmic discrimination; (iii)\nprotections against abusive data practices; (iv) the right to have agency over one\'s data; (v) the right to know when an automated system is\nbeing used; (vi) the right to understand how and why an automated system contributed to outcomes that impact one; (vii) the right to opt out\nof an automated system; and (viii) the right to work with a human in the place of an automated system.\n\nThe legislature also finds that automated systems will continue to be developed and evolve both within the state and outside the state. It\nis therefore critical that New York does not overburden the development of innovative systems that better the state and its residents, nor drive\n\nthe development of such systems to foreign states or countries with less appropriate regulation, nor threaten the security of our state,\ncountry, and its people.\n\nTo these ends, the legislature declares that the white paper published by the White House Office of Science and Technology titled\n""Blueprint for an Al Bill of Rights"" in October of 2022 is commensurate with the goals of this state in relation to artificial intelligence.\n\nSection 3. The state technology law is amended by adding a new article IV to read as follows:\nARTICLE IV\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BILL OF RIGHTS\n\nSection 401, Definitions.\n\n402. Application.\n\n403.

Better public services, high quality jobs and\nopportunities to learn the skills that will power our future — these are the priorities that will drive our goal\nto become a science and technology superpower by 2030.\n\nArtificial intelligence (Al) will play a central part in delivering and enabling these goals, and this white\npaper will ensure we are putting the UK on course to be the best place in the world to build, test and\nuse Al technology. But we are not starting from zero. Having invested over £2.5 billion in Al since 2014,\nthis paper builds on our recent announcements of £110 million for our Al Tech Missions Fund, £900\nmillion to establish a new Al Research Resource and to develop an exascale supercomputer capable of\nrunning large Al models — backed up by our new £8 million Al Global Talent Network and £117 million\nof existing funding to create hundreds of new PhDs for Al researchers.\n\nMost of us are only now beginning to understand the transformative potential of Al as the technology\n\nrapidly improves. But in many ways, Al is already delivering fantastic social and economic benefits for\nreal people — from improving NHS medical care to making transport safer. Recent advances in things\nlike generative Al give us a glimpse into the enormous opportunities that await us in the near future if\n\nwe are prepared to lead the world in the Al sector with our values of transparency, accountability and\n\ninnovation.\n\nMy vision for an Al-enabled country is one where our NHS heroes are able to save lives using Al\ntechnologies that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. | want our police, transport networks and\nclimate scientists and many more to be empowered by Al technologies that will make the UK the\nsmartest, healthiest, safest and happiest place to live and work. That is why Al is one of this\ngovernment's five technologies of tomorrow - bringing stronger growth, better jobs, and bold new\ndiscoveries. It is a vision that has been shaped by stakeholders and experts in Al, whose expertise and\nideas | am determined to see reflected in our department.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of this progress, placing third in the world for Al research and\ndevelopment. We are home to a third of Europe’s total Al companies and twice as many as any other\nEuropean country. Our world-leading status is down to our thriving research base and the pipeline of\n"", ""A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nexpertise graduating through our universities, the ingenuity of our innovators and the government's\nlong-term commitment to invest in Al.\n\nTo ensure we become an Al superpower, though, it is crucial that we do all we can to create the right\nenvironment to harness the benefits of Al and remain at the forefront of technological developments.\nThat includes getting regulation right so that innovators can thrive and the risks posed by Al can be\naddressed.\n\nThese risks could include anything from physical harm, an undermining of national security, as well as\nrisks to mental health. The development and deployment of Al can also present ethical challenges\nwhich do not always have clear answers. Unless we act, household consumers, public services and\nbusinesses will not trust the technology and will be nervous about adopting it. Unless we build public\ntrust, we will miss out on many of the benefits on offer.\n\nIndeed, the pace of change itself can be unsettling. Some fear a future in which Al replaces or\ndisplaces jobs, for example. Our white paper and our vision for a future Al-enabled country is one in\nwhich our ways of working are complemented by Al rather than disrupted by it. In the modern world, too\nmuch of our professional lives are taken up by monotonous tasks — inputting data, filling out paperwork,\nscanning through documents for one piece of information and so on. Al in the workplace has the\npotential to free us up from these tasks, allowing us to spend more time doing the things we trained for\n— teachers with more time to teach, clinicians with more time to spend with patients, police officers with\nmore time on the beat rather than behind a desk — the list goes on.\n\nIndeed, since Al is already in our day-to-day lives, there are numerous examples that can help to\nillustrate the real, tangible benefits that Al can bring once any risks are mitigated. Streaming services\nalready use advanced Al to recommend TV shows and films to us. Our satnav uses Al to plot the\nfastest routes for our journeys, or helps us avoid traffic by intelligently predicting where congestion will\nbe on our journey. And of course, almost all of us carry a smartphone in our pockets that uses\nadvanced Al in all sorts of ways. These common devices all carried risks at one time or another, but\ntoday they benefit us enormously.\n\nThat is why our white paper details how we intend to support innovation while providing a framework to\nensure risks are identified and addressed. However, a heavy-handed and rigid approach can stifle\ninnovation and slow Al adoption. That is why we set out a proportionate and pro-innovation regulatory\nframework. Rather than target specific technologies, it focuses on the context in which Al is deployed.\nThis enables us to take a balanced approach to weighing up the benefits versus the potential risks.\n\nWe recognise that particular Al technologies, foundation models for example, can be applied in many\ndifferent ways and this means the risks can vary hugely. For example, using a chatbot to produce a\nsummary of a long article presents very different risks to using the same technology to provide medical\nadvice. We understand the need to monitor these developments in partnership with innovators while\nalso avoiding placing unnecessary regulatory burdens on those deploying Al.\n\nTo ensure our regulatory framework is effective, we will leverage the expertise of our world class\nregulators. They understand the risks in their sectors and are best placed to take a proportionate\napproach to regulating Al. This will mean supporting innovation and working closely with business, but\nalso stepping in to address risks when necessary. By underpinning the framework with a set of\nprinciples, we will drive consistency across regulators while also providing them with the flexibility\nneeded.\n\nFor innovators working at the cutting edge and developing novel technologies, navigating regulatory\nregimes can be challenging. That’s why we are confirming our commitment to taking forward a key\nrecommendation made by Sir Patrick Vallance to establish a regulatory sandbox for Al. This will bring\ntogether regulators to support innovators directly and help them get their products to market. The\nsandbox will also enable us to understand how regulation interacts with new technologies and refine\nthis interaction where necessary.\n\nHaving exited the European Union we are free to establish a regulatory approach that enables us to\nestablish the UK as an Al superpower. It is an approach that will actively support innovation while\n"", 'A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\naddressing risks and public concerns. The UK is home to thriving start-ups, which our framework will\nsupport to scale-up and compete internationally. Our pro-innovation approach will also act as a strong\nincentive when it comes to Al businesses based overseas establishing a presence in the UK. The white\npaper sets out our commitment to engaging internationally to support interoperability across different\nregulatory regimes. Not only will this ease the burden on business but it will also allow us to embed our\nvalues as global approaches to governing Al develop.\n\nOur approach relies on collaboration between government, regulators and business. Initially, we do not\nintend to introduce new legislation. By rushing to legislate too early, we would risk placing undue\nburdens on businesses. But alongside empowering regulators to take a lead, we are also setting\nexpectations. Our new monitoring functions will provide a real time assessment of how the regulatory\nframework is performing so that we can be confident that it is proportionate. The pace of technological\ndevelopment also means that we need to understand new and emerging risks, engaging with experts to\nensure we take action where necessary. A critical component of this activity will be engaging with the\npublic to understand their expectations, raising awareness of the potential of Al and demonstrating that\nwe are responding to concerns.\n\nThe framework set out in this white paper is deliberately designed to be flexible. As the technology\nevolves, our regulatory approach may also need to adjust. Our principles based approach, with central\nfunctions to monitor and drive collaboration, will enable us to adapt as needed while providing industry\nwith the clarity needed to innovate. We will continue to develop our approach, building on our\ncommitment to making the UK the best place in the world to be a business developing and using Al.\nResponses to the consultation will inform how we develop the regulatory framework - | encourage all of\nthose with an interest to respond.\n\nRT HON MICHELLE DONELAN MP\nSecretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology\nDepartment for Science, Innovation and Technology\n', ""A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nExecutive summary\n\nArtificial intelligence — the opportunity and the challenge\n\n1.

By building trust, we can accelerate the adoption of\nAl across the UK to maximise the economic and social benefits that the technology can deliver,\nwhile attracting investment and stimulating the creation of high-skilled Al jobs. \'? In order to\nmaintain the UK’s position as a global Al leader, we need to ensure that the public continues to\nsee how the benefits of Al can outweigh the risks. \'*\n\nResponding to risk and building public trust are important drivers for regulation. But clear and\nconsistent regulation can also support business investment and build confidence in innovation.\nThroughout our extensive engagement, industry repeatedly emphasised that consumer trust is\nkey to the success of innovation economies. We therefore need a clear, proportionate approach\nto regulation that enables the responsible application of Al to flourish. Instead of creating\ncumbersome rules applying to all Al technologies, our framework ensures that regulatory\nmeasures are proportionate to context and outcomes, by focusing on the use of Al rather than\nthe technology itself.\n\nPeople and organisations develop and use Al in the UK within the rules set by our existing laws,\ninformed by standards, guidance and other tools. But Al is a general purpose technology and its\nuses can cut across regulatory remits. As a result, Al technologies are currently regulated\nthrough a complex patchwork of legal requirements. We are concerned by feedback from across\nindustry that the absence of cross-cutting Al regulation creates uncertainty and inconsistency\nwhich can undermine business and consumer confidence in Al, and stifle innovation. By\nproviding a clear and unified approach to regulation, our framework will build public confidence,\nmaking it clear that Al technologies are subject to cross-cutting, principles-based regulation.\n\nOur pro-innovation framework\n\n8.\n\nThe government will put in place a new framework to bring clarity and coherence to the Al\nregulatory landscape. This regime is designed to make responsible innovation easier.

Our framework is designed to build the evidence base so that we can\nlearn from experience and continuously adapt to develop the best possible regulatory regime.\nIndustry has praised our pragmatic and proportionate approach.\n\nOur framework is underpinned by five principles to guide and inform the responsible\ndevelopment and use of Al in all sectors of the economy:\n\nSafety, security and robustness\nAppropriate transparency and explainability\nFairness\n\nAccountability and governance\nContestability and redress\n\noo00 0\n\nWe will not put these principles on a statutory footing initially. New rigid and onerous legislative\nrequirements on businesses could hold back Al innovation and reduce our ability to respond\nquickly and in a proportionate way to future technological advances. Instead, the principles will\nbe issued on a non-statutory basis and implemented by existing regulators. This approach\nmakes use of regulators’ domain-specific expertise to tailor the implementation of the principles\nto the specific context in which Al is used. During the initial period of implementation, we will\ncontinue to collaborate with regulators to identify any barriers to the proportionate application of\nthe principles, and evaluate whether the non-statutory framework is having the desired effect.\n\nFollowing this initial period of implementation, and when parliamentary time allows, we\nanticipate introducing a statutory duty on regulators requiring them to have due regard to the\nprinciples. Some feedback from regulators, industry and academia suggested we should\nimplement further measures to support the enforcement of the framework. A duty requiring\nregulators to have regard to the principles should allow regulators the flexibility to exercise\njudgement when applying the principles in particular contexts, while also strengthening their\nmandate to implement them. In line with our proposal to work collaboratively with regulators and\ntake an adaptable approach, we will not move to introduce such a statutory duty if our\nmonitoring of the framework shows that implementation is effective without the need to legislate.\n\nIn the 2022 Al regulation policy paper, '® we proposed a small coordination layer within the\nregulatory architecture. Industry and civil society were supportive of our intention to ensure\ncoherence across the Al regulatory framework. However, feedback often argued strongly for\ngreater central coordination to support regulators on issues requiring cross-cutting collaboration\nand ensure that the overall regulatory framework functions as intended.\n\nWe have identified a number of central support functions required to make sure that the overall\nframework offers a proportionate but effective response to risk while promoting innovation\nacross the regulatory landscape:\n\nMonitoring and evaluation of the overall regulatory framework’s effectiveness and the\nimplementation of the principles, including the extent to which implementation supports\ninnovation.

The four key elements are:\n\nDefining Al based on its unique characteristics to support regulator coordination (section 3.2.1).\nAdopting a context-specific approach (section 3.2.2).\n\nProviding a set of cross-sectoral principles to guide regulator responses to Al risks and\nopportunities (section 3.2.3).\n\n° The principles clarify government’s expectations for responsible Al and describe good\ngovernance at all stages of the Al life cycle.\n\n78 Pro-innovation Regulation of Technologies Review: Digital Technologies, HM Treasury, 2023.\n\n79 These characteristics are aligned with existing principles set out in the Plan for Digital Regulation, the report of the\nindependent Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Requlatory Reform and with the findings of the Pro-innovation Regulation of\n\nTechnologies Review: Digital Technologies, published in March 2023, which called for a proportionate and agile regulatory\n\napproach and acknowledged the importance of achieving a “balance between providing clarity and building public trust, while\nalso enabling development, experimentation, and deployment.”\n\n21\n', 'A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\n3.2.1\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\n41.\n\n° The application of the principles will initially be at the discretion of the regulators,\nallowing prioritisation according to the needs of their sectors.\n\n° Following this initial non-statutory period of implementation, and when parliamentary\ntime allows, we anticipate introducing a statutory duty requiring regulators to have due\nregard to the principles.\n\nDelivering new central functions to support regulators to deliver the Al regulatory framework,\nmaximising the benefits of an iterative approach and ensuring that the framework is coherent\n(section 3.2.4).\n\nDefining Artificial Intelligence\n\nTo regulate Al effectively, and to support the clarity of our proposed framework, we need a\ncommon understanding of what is meant by ‘artificial intelligence’. There is no general definition\nof Al that enjoys widespread consensus.® That is why we have defined Al by reference to the\ntwo characteristics that generate the need for a bespoke regulatory response.\n\nThe ‘adaptivity’ of Al can make it difficult to explain the intent or logic of the system’s outcomes:\n\n° Al systems are ‘trained’ — once or continually — and operate by inferring patterns and\nconnections in data which are often not easily discernible to humans.\n\n° Through such training, Al systems often develop the ability to perform new forms of\ninference not directly envisioned by their human programmers.\n\nThe ‘autonomy’ of Al can make it difficult to assign responsibility for outcomes:\n\n° Some Al systems can make decisions without the express intent or ongoing control of a\nhuman.\n\nThe combination of adaptivity and autonomy can make it difficult to explain, predict, or control\nthe outputs of an Al system, or the underlying logic by which they are generated. It can also be\nchallenging to allocate responsibility for the system’s operation and outputs. For regulatory\npurposes, this has potentially serious implications, particularly when decisions are made relating\nto significant matters, like an individual\'s health, or where there is an expectation that a decision\nshould be justifiable in easily understood terms, like a legal ruling.\n\nBy defining Al with reference to these functional capabilities and designing our approach to\naddress the challenges created by these characteristics, we future-proof our framework against\nunanticipated new technologies that are autonomous and adaptive. Because we are not\ncreating blanket new rules for specific technologies or applications of Al, like facial recognition\nor LLMs, we do not need to use rigid legal definitions.

This work will\nbuild on the activity of individual regulators.\n\n3.2.2 Regulating the use — not the technology\n\n45. Our framework is context-specific.®* We will not assign rules or risk levels to entire sectors or\ntechnologies. Instead, we will regulate based on the outcomes Al is likely to generate in\nparticular applications. For example, it would not be proportionate or effective to classify all\napplications of Al in critical infrastructure as high risk. Some uses of Al in critical infrastructure,\nlike the identification of superficial scratches on machinery, can be relatively low risk. Similarly,\nan Al-powered chatbot used to triage customer service requests for an online clothing retailer\nshould not be regulated in the same way as a similar application used as part of a medical\ndiagnostic process.\n\n46. A context-specific approach allows regulators to weigh the risks of using Al against the costs of\nmissing opportunities to do so.** Regulators told us that Al risk assessments should include the\nfailure to exploit Al capabilities. For example, there can be a significant opportunity cost related\nto not having access to Al in safety-critical operations, from heavy industry,® to personal\nhealthcare (see box 1.1). Sensitivity to context will allow the framework to respond to the level of\nrisk in a proportionate manner and avoid stifling innovation or missing opportunities to capitalise\non the social benefits made available by Al.\n\n47. To best achieve this context-specificity we will empower existing UK regulators to apply the\ncross-cutting principles.

System developers should be aware of\nthe specific security threats that could apply at different stages of the All life\ncycle and embed resilience to these threats into their systems.

An appropriate degree of transparency and\nexplainability should be proportionate to the risk(s) presented by an Al\nsystem.\n\nRegulators may need to look for ways to support and encourage relevant life\ncycle actors to implement appropriate transparency measures, for example\nthrough regulatory guidance. Parties directly affected by the use of an Al\nsystem should also be able to access sufficient information about Al systems\nto be able to enforce their rights. In applying the principle to their business\nprocesses, relevant life cycle actors may be asked to provide this information\nin the form and manner required by regulators, including through product\nlabelling.

We are committed to an approach that leverages collaboration with\nour expert regulators but we agree that we may need to intervene further to ensure that our\nframework is effective.\n\nFollowing a period of non-statutory implementation, and when parliamentary time allows, we\nanticipate that we will want to strengthen and clarify regulators’ mandates by introducing a new\nduty requiring them to have due regard to the principles. Such a duty would give a clear signal\nthat we expect regulators to act and support coherence across the regulatory landscape,\nensuring that the framework displays the characteristics that we have identified.'°° One of the\nstrengths of this approach is that regulators would still be able to exercise discretion and expert\njudgement regarding the relevance of each principle to their individual domains.\n\nA duty would ensure that regulators retain the ability to exercise judgement when applying the\nprinciples in particular contexts — benefiting from some of the flexibility expected through non-\nstatutory implementation. For example, while the duty to have due regard would require\nregulators to demonstrate that they had taken account of the principles, it may be the case that\nnot every regulator will need to introduce measures to implement every principle. In having due\nregard to a particular principle, a regulator may exercise their expert judgement and determine\nthat their sector or domain does not require action to be taken. The introduction of the duty will,\nhowever, give regulators a clear mandate and incentive to apply the principles where relevant to\ntheir sectors or domains.\n\nIf our monitoring of the effectiveness of the initial, non-statutory framework suggests that a\nstatutory duty is unnecessary, we would not introduce it. Similarly, we will monitor whether\nparticular principles cannot be, or are not being, applied in certain circumstances or by specific\nregulators because of the interpretation of existing legal requirements or because of technical\nconstraints. Such circumstances may require broader legislative changes. Should we decide\nthere is a need for statutory measures, we will work with regulators to review the interaction of\nour principles with their existing duties and powers.\n\nConsultation questions:\n\n7.

Ahead of introducing any statutory duty to have due regard to our principles, and in\nadvance of introducing other material iterations of the framework, we will consider whether\nexemptions are needed to allow existing regulators (such as those working in areas like national\nsecurity) to continue their domain-level approach.\n\nNot all principles will be equally relevant in all contexts and sometimes two or more principles\nmay come into conflict. For example, it may be difficult to assess the fairness of an algorithm’s\noutputs without access to sensitive personal data about the subjects of the processing.\nRegulators will need to use their expertise and judgement to prioritise and apply the principles in\nsuch cases, sharing information where possible with government and other regulators about\nhow they are assessing the relevance of each principle.

Legal responsibility for compliance with the principles should be allocated to the\nactors in the All life cycle best able to identify, assess and mitigate Al risks effectively.\nIncoherent or misplaced allocation of legal responsibility could hinder innovation or adoption of\nAl.\n\nHowever, Al supply chains can be complex and opaque, making effective governance of Al and\nsupply chain risk management difficult. Inappropriate allocation of Al risk, liability, and\nresponsibility for Al governance throughout the Al life cycle and within Al supply chains could\nimpact negatively on innovation. For example, inappropriate allocation of liability to a business\nusing, but not developing, Al could stifle Al adoption. Similarly, allocating too much responsibility\nto businesses developing foundation models, on the grounds that these models could be used\nby third parties in a range of contexts, would hamper innovation.\n\nWe recognise the need to consider which actors should be responsible and liable for complying\nwith the principles, which may not be the same actors who bear the burden under current legal\nframeworks. For example, data protection law differentiates between data controllers and data\nprocessors. Similarly, product safety laws include the concepts of producers and distributors. In\nthe context of those specific legal frameworks, liability for compliance with various existing legal\nobligations is allocated by law to those identified supply chain actors. It is not yet clear how\nresponsibility and liability for demonstrating compliance with the Al regulatory principles will be\nor should ideally be, allocated to existing supply chain actors within the Al life cycle.\n\nWe are not proposing to intervene and make changes to life cycle accountability at this stage. It\nis too soon to make decisions about liability as it is a complex, rapidly evolving issue which must\nbe handled properly to ensure the success of our wider Al ecosystem. However, to further our\nunderstanding of this topic we will engage a range of experts, including technicians and lawyers.\nIt may become apparent that current legal frameworks, when combined with implementation of\nour Al principles by regulators, will allocate legal responsibility and liability across the supply\nchain in a way that is not fair or effective. We would consider proportionate interventions to\naddress such issues which could otherwise undermine our pro-innovation approach to Al\nregulation.

For example, by describing\nmeasures that manufacturers should take to ensure the safety of Al systems, technical\nstandards can provide reassurance to purchasers and users of Al systems that appropriate\nsafety-focused measures have been adopted, ultimately encouraging adoption of Al.\n\n85. Our evaluation of the framework will assess whether the legal responsibility for Al is effectively\nand fairly distributed.

Some\norganisations exercise close control over the development and distribution of their foundation\nmodels. Other organisations take an open-source approach to the development and distribution\nof the technology. Open-source models can improve access to the transformational power of\nfoundation models, but can cause harm without adequate guardrails.'?° The variation in\norganisational approaches to developing and supplying foundation models introduces a wide\nrange of complexities for the regulation of Al. The potential opacity of foundation models means\nthat it can also be challenging to identify and allocate accountability for outcomes generated by\nAl systems that rely on or integrate them.\n\nOur proposed framework considers the issues raised by foundation models in light of our life\ncycle accountability analysis, outlined in section 3.3.2 above. Given the small number of\norganisations supplying foundation models and a proportionately larger number of businesses\nintegrating or otherwise deploying foundation models elsewhere in the Al ecosystem, we\nrecognise the important role of tools for trustworthy Al, including assurance techniques and\ntechnical standards.\n\nThe proposed central functions described in section 3.3.1 will play an important role in informing\nour approach to regulating foundation models. The central risk function’s proactive, rigorous\nmonitoring of risks associated with foundation models and the horizon scanning function’s\nidentification of related opportunities will be critical to ensuring that we strike the balance\nneeded as part of our proportionate, pro-innovation regulatory approach. It will be crucial to\nensure that the proposed monitoring and evaluation function has access to the technical skills\nand capabilities needed to assess the impact that our framework has on the opportunities and\nrisks presented by foundation models.\n\nWe recognise that industry, academia, research organisations and global partners are looking\nfor ways to address the challenges related to the regulation of foundation models. '° For\nexample, we know that developers of foundation models are exploring ways to embed alignment\ntheory into their models.

It is unlikely that demand for Al assurance can be entirely met through organisations building in-\nhouse capability. The emerging market for Al assurance services and expertise will have an\nimportant role to play in providing a range of assurance techniques to actors within the Al supply\nchain. There is an opportunity for the UK to become a global leader in this market as the Al\nassurance industry develops. This will enable organisations to determine whether Al\ntechnologies are aligned with relevant regulatory requirements.\n\n109.

Bias\nmitigation standards include ISO/IEC TR 24027:2021 and ISO/IEC AWI TS 12791*.\n\n163 For example, safety in healthcare can be addressed by the joint application of management system, risk management and\nquality standards along with horizontal thematic safety standards (e.g., |SO 5469*) and sector specific standards (e.g. BS\n30440*).

The principles were intended to guide\nhow regulators approach Al risks. We outlined our intention for the framework to be coherent,\nproportionate and adaptable, with regulatory coordination to reduce burdens on business and agility to\nkeep pace with rapid technological advancements. Our proposals were designed to strengthen the UK’s\nposition as a global leader in Al by ensuring the UK is the best place to develop and use Al\ntechnologies.\n\nWe launched a call for views on the proposals outlined in our policy paper to capture feedback from\nstakeholders between July and September 2022. We received responses from over 130 different\nstakeholders. There were some clear themes amongst the responses, with stakeholders noting the\nimportance of regulatory coordination and asking for further details on how this will be achieved.\n\nThe 2023 Al regulation white paper sets out our latest position based on the feedback we received. In\nparticular, we have considered the need for new central functions to undertake activities such as\nsystem-wide risk monitoring and evaluation of the Al regulation framework.\n\nWe welcome feedback on our latest proposals and will actively engage stakeholders as part of a\nconsultation running to 21 June. See Annex C for more details on how to contribute to this consultation.\n\nB.2 Background\n\nIn July 2022, we opened a public call for views on our policy paper: Establishing a pro-innovation\napproach to regulating Al. We invited stakeholder views on how the UK can best set the rules for\nregulating Al in a way that drives innovation and growth while also protecting our fundamental values.\nFeedback was collected to inform the development of the white paper.\n\nWe welcomed reflections on our proposed approach and specifically invited views and supporting\nevidence on the following questions:\n\n1 What are the most important challenges with our existing approach to regulating Al? Do you\nhave views on the most important gaps, overlaps or contradictions?\n2 Do you agree with the context-driven approach delivered through the Uk’s established\n\nregulators set out in this paper? What do you see as the benefits of this approach? What are the\ndisadvantages?\n\n3 Do you agree that we should establish a set of cross-sectoral principles to guide our overall\napproach? Do the proposed cross-sectoral principles cover the common issues and risks posed\nby Al technologies? What, if anything, is missing?\n\n4 Do you have any early views on how we best implement our approach? In your view, what are\nsome of the key practical considerations? What will the regulatory system need to deliver on our\napproach? How can we best streamline and coordinate guidance on Al from regulators?\n\n5 Do you anticipate any challenges for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions? Do you\nhave any early views on how our approach could help support cross-border trade and\ninternational cooperation in the most effective way?\n\n179 Establishing a pro-innovation approach to regulating Al, Office for Artificial Intelligence, 2022.\n\n78\n', 'A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\n6 Are you aware of any robust data sources to support monitoring the effectiveness of our\napproach, both at an individual regulator and system level?\n\nThe call for views and evidence was open for 10 weeks, closing on 26 September 2022. In this period\nwe met with 39 stakeholders to capture detailed feedback on our proposals. In total, we received\nresponses from over 130 stakeholders. Stakeholders represented a range of perspectives, from start-\nups to Big Tech, and included developers, deployers, and funders from across the Al life cycle. We also\nheard from researchers, regulators, lawyers, trade bodies and unions as well as representatives from\nthe devolved administrations, local government, and wider public sector.\n\nWe have carefully analysed all the views and evidence submitted. We are grateful for the time and\neffort our stakeholders committed during this process, which has informed and strengthened our policy\nposition as outlined in the white paper.\n\nB.3 Responses\n\nOverall, there was strong support for context specific regulation implemented by existing regulators and\nmany noted that this approach would drive innovation. Stakeholders felt our proposals were a\nproportionate way to establish regulatory best practice in a fast-changing landscape. However,\nresponses also asked for more practical detail, particularly around risk tolerance, compliance\nmeasures, and the overall coherence of the framework.\n\nOur analysis found six overarching themes raised by stakeholders:\n\n1. Articulating the intended societal benefits of Al is key to a future-proofed regulatory vision\nthat works for citizens as well as businesses.\n\nStakeholders were keen to see a long-term vision that set out our ambition to unlock societal benefits\nalongside economic opportunities. Stakeholders broadly agreed that the principles addressed the key\nrisks posed by Al. A number of stakeholders commented that our approach should explicitly reference\nhuman rights. While stakeholders welcomed our alignment with the OECD framework, many felt further\nuse of international approaches by organisations such as the OECD or UNESCO would add more\nhuman focused benefits and aid companies working across jurisdictions. A small number of\nstakeholders noted that environmental sustainability was missing from our principles. Some suggested\nthat it should be included as a core principle, while others recommended that environmental outcomes\nshould be measured through impact assessments.\n\nGovernment response: We have analysed our principles in consideration of both stakeholder\nfeedback and our risk assessment work. The white paper clarifies the substance of the principles in\nsection 3.2.3. Human rights and environmental sustainability are not explicitly named in the revised\nprinciples as we expect regulators to adhere to existing law when implementing the principles. We have\nemphasised the social benefits alongside the economic opportunities we intend to unlock with our pro-\ninnovation approach to Al regulation.\n\n2. Offering greater central clarity around the scope of the regime is critical to ensuring business\nconfidence\n\nA number of stakeholders praised our description of Al for capturing the distinct regulatory challenges\nthat Al poses and our proposed characteristics were largely considered to be fit for purpose. There\nwere some concerns that the definition was not ‘user-friendly’ on its own. While many felt that creating a\nmore specific definition of Al would be difficult and some noted it could be unhelpful, there was clear\nappetite for further detail on how regulators will maintain a coherent definition of Al within and across\nsectors. Use cases were suggested as a means of illustrating Al technologies within scope.\n\n79\n', 'A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nMany stakeholders, especially from industry, were keen to see a clear and transparent risk\nmanagement framework with assessment criteria. In particular, multiple stakeholders felt that it would\nbe beneficial for central government or a central body to provide a clear description of what constitutes\n‘unacceptable risk’. Some suggested this could complement more detailed risk analysis by regulators to\nensure a coordinated and coherent approach — as well as effectively identifying any gaps. Stakeholders\nindicated that greater clarity on risk would support business development and could also promote high\nstandards, public trust, and the adoption of Al.\n\nGovernment response: We stress-tested our proposed characteristics of Al against stakeholder\nfeedback and found that concerns centred on how we would ensure coherence across sectors and\nregulators. We recognise a trade-off between the certainty provided by a blanket approach, such as a\nsingular definition and central risk framework, and the agility enabled by sector-specific expertise,\nincluding regulator-refined definitions. Given the fast pace of technological development and\nstakeholder praise for a future-proofed approach, we have retained our core, defining characteristics for\nAl, see section 3.2.1. We have considered how regulators can be given the technical capability\nnecessary to create clear definitions for Al in and across their sectors, see section 3.2.1. In section\n3.3.1 of the white paper, we outline how new central functions will help identify conflicts or gaps in\nregulator definitions of Al. Acknowledging feedback that a central steer on ‘acceptable’ risk would\nprovide business confidence and investment, we have proposed that centralised risk monitoring and\nhorizon scanning would be key central functions.\n\n3. A principles-based approach will enable regulation to keep pace with a fast-evolving\ntechnology\n\nStakeholders generally agreed that a principles-based approach implemented by regulators would offer\na proportionate way to build best practice. Stakeholders felt the principles address the key risks that Al\nposes while allowing regulators to tailor approaches to their sectors. Stakeholders welcomed our use of\nthe OECD principles as a means of promoting international alignment and interoperability.\n\nWhile stakeholders recognised the benefits that a flexible non-statutory approach offers, some\nstakeholders were concerned that a non-statutory approach would be unenforceable. A few\nstakeholders suggested clarifying how Al regulation dovetails with existing legislation and defining\nthresholds for when our regime may shift to statutory implementation.\n\nGovernment response: We appreciate the praise of our adaptation of the multilaterally agreed OECD\nprinciples. We further outline our international approach in the white paper, recognising that\ninteroperability will help ensure that UK businesses can continue to innovate. While we continue with a\nnon-statutory approach for initial implementation, reflecting on stakeholder concerns around\nenforceability, we anticipate that introducing a statutory duty to have due regard on regulators might be\nneeded to strengthen the framework. A duty to have due regard to our cross-sector principles will\nprovide a legislative incentive while maintaining flexibility for the framework to adapt to technological\nchanges. We will monitor the implementation of the framework to assess whether it is effective without\nthe need to implement a statutory duty and will also review responses to the white paper consultation.\n\n4. Providing centralised coordination and oversight will be essential to regulatory coherence\nand horizon scanning\n\nStakeholders voiced concerns that regulators did not have the capability to ensure a coherent\ncompliance process, especially for businesses operating across or between industry sectors or\nregulatory remits. Stakeholders reported expensive, time-consuming confusion when there was not\nclear regulatory ownership of a technology or issue. Some criticised communication and knowledge-\nsharing between regulators. One stakeholder explained that joint guidance had previously been very\n\n80\n', 'A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nuseful. Others suggested that regulators should have more stringent duties to collaborate to ensure\nconsistency and shared best practice.\n\nA number of stakeholders were supportive of a central coordination function for existing regulators, as\nopposed to a new regulator for Al. Many stressed the importance of a coordination function to aid\nnavigation of trade-offs and conflicts (such as between the need to collect data to minimise bias and the\nneed to refrain from collecting data in the interest of privacy). While many stakeholders stated the need\nfor central coordination, many were solution-agnostic. Proposals included:\n\ne An expanded role for the DRCF. Some stakeholders suggested the DRCF was well-positioned\nto take on a coordination function but others questioned the DRCF’s suitability. In particular, it\nwas felt that the DRCF would require more capacity to fulfil a coordination role.\n\ne Anew central body to undertake coordination. Stakeholders suggested establishing a new\nbody, such as a ‘Centre for Al Governance’, to undertake functions such as: conducting cross-\nsector risk-mapping; conducting regulatory gap analyses and horizon scanning; monitoring the\napplicability of emerging Al standards; supplying training; and monitoring international\napproaches.\n\ne Appointing an existing regulator as ‘lead regulator’ for Al. Some stakeholders felt that\nregulators should have more incentives to work together and the entire regulatory landscape\ncould learn from more advanced regulators.\n\nStakeholders stated the importance of clarifying regulator remits and addressing gaps, noting the fast\npace of change for Al technologies. Some suggested that a coordination body should be responsible for\na horizon scanning function that monitors and evaluates risks.\n\nGovernment response: Building on reflections from stakeholders, we identified a small range of\nregulators with remits that are likely to be significantly affected by Al and conducted analysis of their\ncapability to implement our policy paper proposals. We found varied readiness, with some regulators\nalready demonstrating world-leading approaches to regulating Al and others asking for further support.\nSimilarly, knowledge and information sharing mechanisms were not uniform across regulators and we\nidentified a need for coordination mechanisms to streamline compliance processes for business and\nensure regulation provides system-wide coverage of current and future opportunities. We considered\nmultiple options for coordination functions, in line with stakeholder suggestions, and incorporated\nfeedback into our analysis. We outline our proposals for central functions in section 3.3.1 in the white\npaper.\n\n5. Streamlining liability and tailoring reporting obligations will be key to enabling responsible\ninnovation\n\nWhile stakeholders were strongly supportive of compliance and assurance as a means of facilitating\npublic trust and the wider adoption of Al technologies, many were keen to limit the burden of reporting\nobligations, particularly for startups and SMEs. Industry stakeholders noted that the costs of reporting\nburdens would be passed onto consumers. Some stakeholders emphasised that the government\nshould have a role in providing education and support for small businesses.\n\nThere was interest in regulatory sandboxes as a way to enable investment and establish best practice.\nGenerally there was a strong appetite for industry-led solutions and a less burdensome or ‘tick box’\napproach to compliance. Stakeholders were strongly supportive of standards as a way to drive\naccountability, adoption, and good consumer outcomes. Stakeholders suggested sector compliance\ntemplates and voluntary industry forums as ways to share knowledge and reduce the burden of\nestablishing best practice.\n\nSome stakeholders felt the paper lacked a position on liability and argued a clear allocation of legal\nresponsibility would enable effective enforcement and unlock investment. More specifically, some\n\n81\n', ""A pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nstakeholders suggested that, when appropriate, targeting foundation models (often developed by larger\norganisations) would increase innovation and competition by reducing liability burdens on smaller\ncompanies. Stakeholders often suggested impact assessments could be used to help address liability\nissues at all stages of the Al life cycle.\n\nGovernment response: We welcomed the thoughtful suggestions from respondents regarding\ninnovative compliance measures. We noted the significant appetite for regulatory sandboxes and have\noutlined our proposals in the white paper, see section 3.3.4. We agree that reporting burdens should be\nproportionate and give detail on how we will continue to work with regulators to ensure compliance\nmeasures are streamlined. We acknowledge that regulation measures can affect competition and\ninnovation by creating undue burdens on start-ups and SMEs. We are confident that regulators will\noversee proportionate and innovation friendly measures in their remits, with a central function\nundertaking activity to streamline and ensure coherence. We recognise that liability is complicated by a\ncomplex Al value-chain that can incorporate many different actors in different roles. As such, we believe\nthat regulators are best positioned to begin allocating liability in their sectors, adopting a context-based\napproach that builds on best practice. Our proposal setting out activities to be undertaken centrally will\nensure that regulators’ approaches to liability are proportionate, coherent across sectors, and\nsupportive of innovation.\n\n6. Establishing interoperability will be critical to ensuring an internationally competitive\napproach\n\nStakeholders welcomed the UK's relatively flexible approach but many were concerned that the need\nfor interoperability across jurisdictions would result in businesses conforming to the strictest regulation.\nStakeholders warned that international divergence could create more burdens than advantages for\nbusinesses. Many stakeholders wanted friction minimised to ensure export prospects for British\nbusinesses, with support for an international agreement on Al regulation equivalence, where Al\nsystems authorised on key international markets would be permitted for trade in the UK. Many\nstakeholders also wanted to see the UK maintain its position as a global leader in Al discussions.\nStakeholders emphasised the importance of alignment with international partners such as the EU and\nUS to ensure global Al governance supports our common democratic values.\n\nGovernment response: In the white paper, we set out our vision for Al regulation to ensure that the\nUK is the best place to start and grow an Al business. We share stakeholder concerns on\ninteroperability and plan to continue using our leading role in international forums such as the OECD,\nG7, and Council of Europe to promote pro-innovation approaches to regulation that capitalise on the\npotential social and economic benefits of Al while addressing the new risks the technology can pose.\nOur plan for international engagement, detailed in part six, clarifies our approach with an emphasis on\ninteroperability.\n\n82\n"", 'a F&F WwW N\n\nA pro-innovation approach to Al regulation\n\nAnnex C: How to respond to this\nconsultation\n\nWe are inviting individuals and organisations to provide their views by responding to the questions set\nout in this consultation.

Sec. 1. The legislature finds that artificial\nintelligence is a fast-evolving technology that holds extraordinary\npotential and has a myriad of uses for both the public and private\nsectors. Advances in artificial intelligence technology have led to\nprograms that are capable of creating text, audio, and media that are\ndifficult to distinguish from media created by a human. This\ntechnology has the potential to provide great benefits to people if\nused well and to cause great harm if used irresponsibly.\n\nThe legislature further finds that generative artificial\nintelligence has become widely available to consumers and has great\npotential to become a versatile tool for a wide audience. It can\nstreamline tasks, save time and money for users, and facilitate\nfurther innovation. Artificial intelligence has the potential to help\nsolve urgent challenges, while making our world more prosperous,\nproductive, innovative, and secure when used responsibly.\n\nWashington state is in a unique position to become a center for\nartificial intelligence and machine learning.

It is vital\nthat the fundamental rights to privacy and freedom from\ndiscrimination are properly safeguarded as society explores this\nemerging technology.\n\nThe federal government has not yet enacted binding regulations,\nhowever in July 2023, the federal government announced voluntary\ncommitments by seven leading artificial intelligence companies,\nincluding three companies headquartered in Washington, to move toward\nsafe, secure, and transparent development of artificial intelligence\ntechnology. The October 2023 executive order on the safe, secure, and\ntrustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence builds on\nthis work by directing developers of artificial intelligence systems\nto share their safety test results for certain highly capable models\nwith the United States government.\n\nNumerous businesses and agencies have developed principles for\nartificial intelligence. In Washington, Washington technology\nsolutions (WaTech) developed guiding principles for artificial\nintelligence use by state agencies. These principles share common\nthemes: Accountability, transparency, human control, privacy and\nsecurity, advancing equity, and promoting innovation and economic\ndevelopment.\n\nThe legislature finds that the possible impacts of advancements\nin generative artificial intelligence for Washingtonians requires\ncareful consideration in order to mitigate risks and potential harms,\nwhile promoting transparency, accountability, equity, and innovation\nthat drives technological breakthroughs.
